  "articleBody": "WayBack Three months ago, smack in the middle of my first semester university exams, I found myself pondering a big question: “What minor skill can I pick up to keep my hacking chops sharp?” Something that would make me feel like a “hecker” and not just another stressed-out student.\nAnd then, a light bulb moment! 💡 CVEs! I dove headfirst into the wonderful (and sometimes daunting) world of CVEs. I came across three fantastic resources that became my road map to success:\n8 CVEs in 2 Weeks is Crazy – Spoiler: it really is. Tips on Getting Your First CVE – Trust me, this was pure gold! Found a CVE? How to Report – Because finding is one thing, but reporting is a whole different ball game. The Hunt Begins Armed with new knowledge and a thirst for exploits, I decided to go big or go home. I started poking around open-source platforms like GitHub, using some good old-fashioned Google dorks like:\ninurl:\"/docs/\" \"powered by PHP\" OR \"PHP CMS\" I aimed my sights at CMS platforms, focusing primarily on the PHP, Apache2, and MySQL stack. And then, jackpot! 🎰 I hit on a CMS called Mozilo, a popular German CMS. Hecker Mode: Activated!\nThe Workflow of a Hecker So, what did my journey look like from finding the vulnerabilities to getting them published? Let me break it down:\nVulnerability Discovery: After digging around in Mozilo, I found some vulnerabilities that made me raise an eyebrow (or two). Vendor Notification: I immediately reported the vulnerability to the Mozilo team on Aug 19, 2024, at 11:59 AM. To MITRE We Go!: With no vendor response, I submitted the vulnerabilities to MITRE on Aug 19, 2:37 PM, marking the vendor confirmation as “No.” The Waiting Game: The status was set to “Reserved” on Sep 5, 2:39 PM. Let’s Publish!: I sent a publication request to MITRE on Sep 6, 5:19 PM. Patience is a virtue… but I was getting impatient! Success!: Finally, on Sep 10, 5:38 PM, the CVEs were published! 🎉 So… Am I a Hecker Yet? 🤔 I’ve been asking myself this question a lot lately. I mean, I’ve got two fresh CVEs to my name, and they’re not just any CVEs – we’re talking Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-44871) and Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-44872). You can check them out here if you’re curious:\nCVE-2024-44871 CVE-2024-44872 So, according to the cyber security community, I’m starting to make a name for myself. But if you ask my family? Oh, boy. 😅\nYou’d think two CVEs would be enough to prove my “hecker” credentials. Yet, my family still doesn’t get it. My mom’s idea of my hacking career? She thinks it’s all about recovering her friend’s hacked WhatsApp account.\nMom: \"Olaoluwa, can you help recover my friend's WhatsApp? It's been hacked!\" Me: \"Mom, I just found a remote code execution vulnerability in a popular CMS.\" Mom: \"So… can you get her WhatsApp back or not?\" Honestly, I don’t even know where to start with that. 😂 I try explaining that I find vulnerabilities in software, not people’s social media, but to her, all hackers are the same.
