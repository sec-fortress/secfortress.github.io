I dove headfirst into the wonderful (and sometimes daunting) world of CVEs. I came across three fantastic resources that became my road map to success:\n8 CVEs in 2 Weeks is Crazy – Spoiler: it really is. Tips on Getting Your First CVE – Trust me, this was pure gold! Found a CVE? How to Report – Because finding is one thing, but reporting is a whole different ball game. The Hunt Begins Armed with new knowledge and a thirst for exploits, I decided to go big or go home. I started poking around open-source platforms like GitHub, using some good old-fashioned Google dorks like:\ninurl:\"/docs/\" \"powered by PHP\" OR \"PHP CMS\" I aimed my sights at CMS platforms, focusing primarily on the PHP, Apache2, and MySQL stack. And then, jackpot! 🎰 I hit on a CMS called Mozilo, a popular German CMS. Hecker Mode: Activated!\nThe Workflow of a Hecker So, what did my journey look like from finding the vulnerabilities to getting them published? Let me break it down:\nVulnerability Discovery: After digging around in Mozilo, I found some vulnerabilities that made me raise an eyebrow (or two). Vendor Notification: I immediately reported the vulnerability to the Mozilo team on Aug 19, 2024, at 11:59 AM. To MITRE We Go!: With no vendor response, I submitted the vulnerabilities to MITRE on Aug 19, 2:37 PM, marking the vendor confirmation as “No.” The Waiting Game: The status was set to “Reserved” on Sep 5, 2:39 PM. Let’s Publish!: I sent a publication request to MITRE on Sep 6, 5:19 PM. Patience is a virtue… but I was getting impatient! Success!: Finally, on Sep 10, 5:38 PM, the CVEs were published! 🎉 So… Am I a Hecker Yet? 🤔 I’ve been asking myself this question a lot lately. I mean, I’ve got two fresh CVEs to my name, and they’re not just any CVEs – we’re talking Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-44871) and Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-44872). You can check them out here if you’re curious:\nCVE-2024-44871 CVE-2024-44872 So, according to the cyber security community, I’m starting to make a name for myself. But if you ask my family? Oh, boy. 😅\nYou’d think two CVEs would be enough to prove my “hecker” credentials. Yet, my family still doesn’t get it. My mom’s idea of my hacking career?

It's been hacked!\" Me: \"Mom, I just found a remote code execution vulnerability in a popular CMS.\" Mom: \"So… can you get her WhatsApp back or not?\" Honestly, I don’t even know where to start with that. 😂 I try explaining that I find vulnerabilities in software, not people’s social media, but to her, all hackers are the same.
