Crossed a financial milestone, earning seven figures consecutively in under three months - a testament to persistence, faith, and growth. Growth Never Stands Still My life has turned sharply toward the light ever since I chose to be intentional with myself.\nI remember beginning this year on a ‚Ç¶250k job that drained every ounce of me.\nI gave it my best perfect effort, worthy lessons and yet a quiet voice kept whispering, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the life you‚Äôre reaching for.‚Äù\nBut here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come to see: every path, whether lined with roses or thorns, shapes us.\nEvery detour, every hard day, is a signpost pointing us closer to the place we‚Äôre meant for, or the place our hearts have long been calling home.\nGrowth never stands still. No matter how content you feel in one place, wisdom says: always have a backup plan.\nIt‚Äôs Not the Party; It‚Äôs the People These past months have handed me some sharp realities. I‚Äôve learned there‚Äôs no perfect workplace, only people and how people treat one another, regardless of hierarchy, can decide whether a business keeps its talent or bleeds it away.\nIt‚Äôs never about HR throwing a party to welcome you as a ‚Äúrespected individual.‚Äù\nWhat truly matters is the quiet, daily moments, the tone of a message, the fairness of a decision, the way leaders make room for voices at every level.\nBecause culture isn‚Äôt built on confetti (reminds me of this quote \u003e ‚ÄúCulture eats strategy for breakfast.‚Äù ‚Äì Peter Drucker), it‚Äôs built on consistency, respect, and care and that‚Äôs what makes people stay.\nBuilding Wealth, Weathering Change Lately, I‚Äôve been deeply intentional about my finances, pushing myself with the mindset that I must build lasting wealth legally, no matter how tough the journey gets. I set a clear road map toward a specific financial goal, and in less than three months, I‚Äôve been steadily crushing those milestones.\nI can say without hesitation that tech has completely transformed my life; from bug bounty hunting to meaningful referrals. There‚Äôs so much I can‚Äôt even share publicly yet due to confidentiality, but like I said in my previous blog, this is only the beginning. And above all, I give credit to God for making all of this possible.\nAlong the way, I experienced the loss of a critical relationship. While I acknowledge my own faults because none of us are perfect, the experience served as a powerful reminder to keep my eyes on both what lies ahead and what surrounds me now. Life has a way of shifting dramatically and without warning, so it‚Äôs crucial not to get too comfortable in any season.\nA Farewell to Dante Today, I lost my beloved cat, Dante. For someone like me, who doesn‚Äôt always have people around every day; he wasn‚Äôt just a pet, he was family. From the moment this mischievous orange ball of fur came into my life, things changed. He filled my space with laughter, kept me on my toes, and reminded me that life isn‚Äôt just about work and routine.\nDante had a way of pulling me out of my own head, biting my leg when I was too focused, leaping onto me unexpectedly, or even playing a little hide and seek. As annoying as he could sometimes be, he was perfect in his own, unique way.\nRare footage of me sneaking up on him üòÇ:\nThis morning, in a tragic accident, I lost him. It was unintentional, but the pain of it; the guilt and the heartbreak is overwhelming. I held him on my lap for the last time, whispered my thanks for all the joy he brought me, and said goodbye.\nDante, if love could have saved you, you would‚Äôve lived forever. Thank you for every small moment of happiness you gave me. I‚Äôll miss you dearly, and I pray for the strength to forgive myself and to someday open my heart to another companion.\nBuilding the Life and Workspace I Once Dreamed Of One thing I remain deeply grateful for is how far my finances and stability have come. These days, there‚Äôs hardly anything I truly need that a steady two-month compensation couldn‚Äôt cover, whether it‚Äôs a powerful new laptop, a phone upgrade, a camera, or anything else I once considered out of reach. This is the life I prayed for, and I don‚Äôt take it for granted.\nI‚Äôm still building out my workspace, making sure it reflects both comfort and ambition. I recently invested in an electric desk, a supportive chair, and even a desktop to ensure nothing stands in the way of focus and creativity. Above all, I‚Äôm thankful to God for where I am today. There‚Äôs still a long road of grinding ahead, but I‚Äôm excited for the journey and I pray it stays as thrilling and rewarding as it‚Äôs been so far.\nOne thing I realized is that; No season stays the same, life can take and give in the very same breath. In just a few months, I‚Äôve tasted wins, losses, and lessons I never saw coming. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: keep showing up for yourself. Stay humble in victory, patient in struggle, and grateful in every moment between.\nKeep investing in your growth, build genuine connections, and remember even small, consistent steps compound into incredible change. The journey isn‚Äôt about perfection, it‚Äôs about persistence. And as long as you keep moving forward, you‚Äôre already winning. LFG my gee!!!!\n",
