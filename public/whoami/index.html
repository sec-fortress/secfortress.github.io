Familiarity with security frameworks including OWASP Top 10, Microsoft SDL, MITRE ATT\u0026CK Framework and SANS Top 25. Knowledgeable on defensive security concepts including SIEM and threat hunting. Actively pursuing the OSCP certification and cloud security to further validate proficiency and skill set.\n💻 Infosec, or about 80% of my life My love for Infosec started six years ago. With no mentor or anyone to guide me, I began my journey using TryHackMe.com, YouTube, and Stack Overflow to learn. Later on, I took the Security+ course from ITPro.TV, which allowed me to grasp the basics of cybersecurity, covering areas such as Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Cloud and Virtualization, Operational Security, and Incident Response.\nWith this, I was able to continue my learning journey with various other platforms like HackTheBox, PortSwigger, HackMyVM, Vulnix, etc., which gave me a higher advantage in gaining practical experience. Most notably, playing Boot2Root CTFs provided me with an opportunity to join a CTF team called “5h4d0wbr0k3r5,” giving me a more solid understanding of penetration testing.\nI then landed my first role as a web application penetration tester at a company in India. From there, I secured another job in Nigeria as a network penetration tester, where I gained substantial experience in technical skills like Active Directory and Linux administration. Additionally, I developed soft skills in managing co-workers and working effectively as part of a team.\nI was fortunate to have all my penetration testing exams sponsored, for which I am truly grateful. I have also made a lot of trustworthy and 1337 friends like hac, obx, n16ht4wk, ramsey, rami, fr3y, nerdy, ezequiel, Kunal and many others including someone who I am really looking upto, @hackingdave. I don’t know what the future holds, but continuous learning is key for me. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges in a dynamic company where I can contribute to and grow with the team.\n🏅 Checklists and Certifications This is a non-exhaustive list of certifications and courses I have taken.\nCertified Red Team Professional (badge here)\nOffensive Security Certified Professional (badge here)\nCertified Penetration Testing Specialist (badge here)\nJunior Penetration Tester (PT1) (badge here)\nDante, Penetration Tester Level II lab (badge here)\nZephyr, Red Team Operator Level I lab (badge here)\nFew CVEs under my belt; CVE-2024-44871, CVE-2024-44872, CVE-2024-55341, CVE-2024-55342\nCurrently reading the book “Penetration Testing Azure for Ethical Hackers” by David Okeyode and Karl Fosaaen\n🪟 Life outside of infosec, the last 20% Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I enjoy making good food, building positive relationships, watching anime, and listening to good music. I listen to music while doing almost all of my day-to-day activities, which helps me achieve total concentration. Additionally, I am currently pursuing a degree in Criminology and Security Studies (BSc) at an Open University to expand my knowledge in addressing real-world challenges. This program enhances my understanding of criminal behavior and law enforcement, providing a broader perspective on how to protect systems and data from various threats.\n✨ Future plans I plan to pursue in the field of Cloud Security and Penetration Testing. My goal, is never to be the best but to always keep learning, improving, and making a meaningful impact in the field of Cyber security.\nThe key to accomplishing all that you ever wanted, the key to changing who you are, the key to reaching new heights, the key to limitless personal power… Is just believing in yourself; - Mr. Ping\n",
