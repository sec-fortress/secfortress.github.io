Actively pursuing the OSCP certification and cloud security to further validate proficiency and skill set.\nüíª Infosec, or about 80% of my life My love for Infosec started six years ago. With no mentor or anyone to guide me, I began my journey using TryHackMe.com, YouTube, and Stack Overflow to learn. Later on, I took the Security+ course from ITPro.TV, which allowed me to grasp the basics of cybersecurity, covering areas such as Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Cloud and Virtualization, Operational Security, and Incident Response.\nWith this, I was able to continue my learning journey with various other platforms like HackTheBox, PortSwigger, HackMyVM, Vulnix, etc., which gave me a higher advantage in gaining practical experience. Most notably, playing Boot2Root CTFs provided me with an opportunity to join a CTF team called ‚Äú5h4d0wbr0k3r5,‚Äù giving me a more solid understanding of penetration testing.\nI then landed my first role as a web application penetration tester at a company in India. From there, I secured another job in Nigeria as a network penetration tester, where I gained substantial experience in technical skills like Active Directory and Linux administration. Additionally, I developed soft skills in managing co-workers and working effectively as part of a team.\nI was fortunate to have all my penetration testing exams sponsored, for which I am truly grateful.
