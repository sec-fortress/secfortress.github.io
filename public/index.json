[{"content":"The Hook There is only one reason why this blog is up; I tried running a phishing engagement requested by a client and \u0026ldquo;Gophish\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;SMTP\u0026rdquo; setup had me hit a few blockers than I thought, due to compliance policies and time constraints.\nEven after reaching out to DO and Amazon for a valid reason like, \u0026ldquo;the client is aware and this is done in a well controlled and authorized environment\u0026rdquo;; to use their SES, it still didn’t sit well with their policies. And honestly, I completely understand. Some platforms simply won’t bend their rules, no matter how legitimate your use case is.\nBlocker 1: DigitalOcean blocks outbound SMTP connections by default to prevent spam and abuse. This meant I couldn’t connect GoPhish to external SMTP servers at all, instantly halting the initial setup pathway.\nBlocker 2: Amazon SES allows sending only to verified email addresses and domains when your account is in the sandbox environment. To move out of this restricted state, you must submit a detailed request explaining your use case and proving it is safe, compliant, and legitimate. Even with proper justification, approvals are not guaranteed and timelines can be unpredictable.\nThe Process You can go ahead and buy a similar looking domain to the original one at https://domains.cloudflare.com/\nUpon successful purchase of the domain, navigating to DNS -\u0026gt; Records, you should have an empty dns record list like the below\nNavigate to https://www.zoho.com/mail/signup.html to create a mail account and fill in the requirements as splay\nYou should get a 7 digit OTP code to verify your account in the Email provided\nFill in the OTP to continue\nWe can skip the below page by starting the 15 days free trial (No credit card required)\nNext we can go ahead and select \u0026ldquo;Add an existing domain\u0026rdquo;\nThen add up the domain we created on cloud flare before and fill the organization name respectfully\nYou can then choose to authenticate\nOnce this is done navigate to https://directory.zoho.com/directory/[ORGANIZATION]/adminhome#/users/new\nSelect \u0026ldquo;USERS\u0026rdquo; Fill up field respectively imitating target email pattern Then click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; Below form imitates hr department at target organization\nProgress In Between Problems There are two blockers I encountered and solutions to solving them:\nOutlook/Gmail Deliverability Requirements:\nyou need to either find a way to boost the domain or work with the client’s IT team to allow list/approve your phishing domain. Without allowlisting, emails may land in Spam due to Microsoft’s filtering rules. Send test emails to confirm inbox delivery before launching the full campaign. The above mostly doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect gmail client. Using Client EML/ZIP Samples for Template Accuracy:\nIt is possible to request sample EML files from HR/IT strategically. Or even better get it via an ongoing red team engagement. Then we can Import the EML files into Zoho Mail to fine-tune your simulation, ensuring the messages align with the organization’s communication style and improve overall engagement accuracy. Login to zoho mail with the previous created account and click on the settings Icon at the top right\nYou should see a pop up window, scroll down and select \u0026ldquo;Import/Export Emails\u0026rdquo; \u0026raquo; \u0026ldquo;Browse for eml or zip file\u0026rdquo;\nOnce this is done, the email template should be imported to your inbox If an email template has an image email signature, download the image and add it manually to zoho Re-adding email signature Navigate to settings as done previously\nClick on the drop down to add the downloaded image email signature\nYou can set other preferences also to make it comfortable sending multiple emails\nPlease ignore the dummy email signature as shown above\nExporting mails from outlook/gmail to import to zoho Below are the following steps to export an email template from outlook (Ask client to do this)\nBelow are the following steps to export an email template from gmail\nThe Tough Question Since this is a phishing campaign, a common question that often comes up is: How do we accurately measure success? How do we determine the percentage of users who clicked a link, submitted credentials, attempted to log in, or interacted with the payload in any way?\nWhile metrics are important, the more critical factor is the environment you’re testing. Every organization is different, and an effective phishing simulation requires a deep understanding of the client; how they communicate, what they’re accustomed to, and what they are most likely (or unlikely) to fall for.\nBefore execution, it’s essential to study the client thoroughly to understand these behavioral patterns. That insight ultimately determines the realism and effectiveness of the campaign.\nTo address this, I’ll walk you through a process I developed in collaboration with a highly skilled DevSecOps engineer, @Saintmalik_. Together, we designed an approach that significantly improved the success of the phishing engagement. Below is a breakdown of the metrics we used to evaluate the campaign’s performance.\nUnfortunately, this is where I’ll have to bring this blog to an end. There are still many details I’m unable to disclose for personal and confidentiality reasons. That said, I genuinely hope this write-up helps someone navigating similar challenges or planning a similar engagement.\nSometimes, sharing just enough is enough to make a difference.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/phishing_with_cloudflare_+_zoho_mail/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-hook\"\u003eThe Hook\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is only one reason why this blog is up; I tried running a phishing engagement requested by a client and \u0026ldquo;Gophish\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;SMTP\u0026rdquo; setup had me hit a few blockers than I thought, due to compliance policies and time constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after reaching out to DO and Amazon for a valid reason like, \u0026ldquo;the client is aware and this is done in a well controlled and authorized environment\u0026rdquo;; to use their SES, it still didn’t sit well with their policies.

Began crafting a dedicated workspace, shaping an environment that fuels focus and creativity. Faced the heartbreak of relationships ending Said goodbye to my second pet cat, lost to a tragic accident ;; proof that even small companions leave big spaces in our hearts. Crossed a financial milestone, earning seven figures consecutively in under three months - a testament to persistence, faith, and growth. Growth Never Stands Still My life has turned sharply toward the light ever since I chose to be intentional with myself.\nI remember beginning this year on a ₦250k job that drained every ounce of me.\nI gave it my best perfect effort, worthy lessons and yet a quiet voice kept whispering, “This isn’t the life you’re reaching for.”\nBut here’s what I’ve come to see: every path, whether lined with roses or thorns, shapes us.\nEvery detour, every hard day, is a signpost pointing us closer to the place we’re meant for, or the place our hearts have long been calling home.\nGrowth never stands still. No matter how content you feel in one place, wisdom says: always have a backup plan.\nIt’s Not the Party; It’s the People These past months have handed me some sharp realities. I’ve learned there’s no perfect workplace, only people and how people treat one another, regardless of hierarchy, can decide whether a business keeps its talent or bleeds it away.\nIt’s never about HR throwing a party to welcome you as a “respected individual.”\nWhat truly matters is the quiet, daily moments, the tone of a message, the fairness of a decision, the way leaders make room for voices at every level.\nBecause culture isn’t built on confetti (reminds me of this quote \u0026gt; “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” – Peter Drucker), it’s built on consistency, respect, and care and that’s what makes people stay.\nBuilding Wealth, Weathering Change Lately, I’ve been deeply intentional about my finances, pushing myself with the mindset that I must build lasting wealth legally, no matter how tough the journey gets. I set a clear road map toward a specific financial goal, and in less than three months, I’ve been steadily crushing those milestones.\nI can say without hesitation that tech has completely transformed my life; from bug bounty hunting to meaningful referrals. There’s so much I can’t even share publicly yet due to confidentiality, but like I said in my previous blog, this is only the beginning. And above all, I give credit to God for making all of this possible.\nAlong the way, I experienced the loss of a critical relationship. While I acknowledge my own faults because none of us are perfect, the experience served as a powerful reminder to keep my eyes on both what lies ahead and what surrounds me now. Life has a way of shifting dramatically and without warning, so it’s crucial not to get too comfortable in any season.\nA Farewell to Dante Today, I lost my beloved cat, Dante. For someone like me, who doesn’t always have people around every day; he wasn’t just a pet, he was family. From the moment this mischievous orange ball of fur came into my life, things changed. He filled my space with laughter, kept me on my toes, and reminded me that life isn’t just about work and routine.\nDante had a way of pulling me out of my own head, biting my leg when I was too focused, leaping onto me unexpectedly, or even playing a little hide and seek. As annoying as he could sometimes be, he was perfect in his own, unique way.\nRare footage of me sneaking up on him 😂:\nThis morning, in a tragic accident, I lost him. It was unintentional, but the pain of it; the guilt and the heartbreak is overwhelming. I held him on my lap for the last time, whispered my thanks for all the joy he brought me, and said goodbye.\nDante, if love could have saved you, you would’ve lived forever. Thank you for every small moment of happiness you gave me. I’ll miss you dearly, and I pray for the strength to forgive myself and to someday open my heart to another companion.\nBuilding the Life and Workspace I Once Dreamed Of One thing I remain deeply grateful for is how far my finances and stability have come. These days, there’s hardly anything I truly need that a steady two-month compensation couldn’t cover, whether it’s a powerful new laptop, a phone upgrade, a camera, or anything else I once considered out of reach. This is the life I prayed for, and I don’t take it for granted.\nI’m still building out my workspace, making sure it reflects both comfort and ambition. I recently invested in an electric desk, a supportive chair, and even a desktop to ensure nothing stands in the way of focus and creativity. Above all, I’m thankful to God for where I am today. There’s still a long road of grinding ahead, but I’m excited for the journey and I pray it stays as thrilling and rewarding as it’s been so far.\nOne thing I realized is that; No season stays the same, life can take and give in the very same breath. In just a few months, I’ve tasted wins, losses, and lessons I never saw coming. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: keep showing up for yourself. Stay humble in victory, patient in struggle, and grateful in every moment between.\nKeep investing in your growth, build genuine connections, and remember even small, consistent steps compound into incredible change. The journey isn’t about perfection, it’s about persistence. And as long as you keep moving forward, you’re already winning.

Actively pursuing the OSCP certification and cloud security to further validate proficiency and skill set.\n💻 Infosec, or about 80% of my life My love for Infosec started six years ago. With no mentor or anyone to guide me, I began my journey using TryHackMe.com, YouTube, and Stack Overflow to learn. Later on, I took the Security+ course from ITPro.TV, which allowed me to grasp the basics of cybersecurity, covering areas such as Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Cloud and Virtualization, Operational Security, and Incident Response.\nWith this, I was able to continue my learning journey with various other platforms like HackTheBox, PortSwigger, HackMyVM, Vulnix, etc., which gave me a higher advantage in gaining practical experience. Most notably, playing Boot2Root CTFs provided me with an opportunity to join a CTF team called \u0026ldquo;5h4d0wbr0k3r5,\u0026rdquo; giving me a more solid understanding of penetration testing.\nI then landed my first role as a web application penetration tester at a company in India. From there, I secured another job in Nigeria as a network penetration tester, where I gained substantial experience in technical skills like Active Directory and Linux administration. Additionally, I developed soft skills in managing co-workers and working effectively as part of a team.\nI was fortunate to have all my penetration testing exams sponsored, for which I am truly grateful. I have also made a lot of trustworthy and 1337 friends like hac, obx, n16ht4wk, ramsey, rami, fr3y, nerdy, ezequiel, Kunal and many others including someone who I am really looking upto, @hackingdave. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the future holds, but continuous learning is key for me. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges in a dynamic company where I can contribute to and grow with the team.\n🏅 Checklists and Certifications This is a non-exhaustive list of certifications and courses I have taken.\nCertified Red Team Professional (badge here)\nOffensive Security Certified Professional (badge here)\nCertified Penetration Testing Specialist (badge here)\nJunior Penetration Tester (PT1) (badge here)\nDante, Penetration Tester Level II lab (badge here)\nZephyr, Red Team Operator Level I lab (badge here)\nFew CVEs under my belt; CVE-2024-44871, CVE-2024-44872, CVE-2024-55341, CVE-2024-55342\nCurrently reading the book “Penetration Testing Azure for Ethical Hackers” by David Okeyode and Karl Fosaaen\n🪟 Life outside of infosec, the last 20% Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I enjoy making good food, building positive relationships, watching anime, and listening to good music. I listen to music while doing almost all of my day-to-day activities, which helps me achieve total concentration. Additionally, I am currently pursuing a degree in Criminology and Security Studies (BSc) at an Open University to expand my knowledge in addressing real-world challenges. This program enhances my understanding of criminal behavior and law enforcement, providing a broader perspective on how to protect systems and data from various threats.\n✨ Future plans I plan to pursue in the field of Cloud Security and Penetration Testing. My goal, is never to be the best but to always keep learning, improving, and making a meaningful impact in the field of Cyber security.\nThe key to accomplishing all that you ever wanted, the key to changing who you are, the key to reaching new heights, the key to limitless personal power… Is just believing in yourself; - Mr. Ping\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/whoami/","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-introduction\"\u003e❓ Introduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHii, I am a 20 yr/old security researcher/penetration tester with extensive networking, scripting, linux administration, active directory and a little cloud experience.
