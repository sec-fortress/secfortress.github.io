[{"content":"\rNot Your Regular Hacking Blog This isn’t your regular hacking blog. You won\u0026rsquo;t find just the usual tutorials or technical breakdowns here. Instead, consider this a reflection, a look into the life of someone who chose the path less traveled, who found a passion in cybersecurity and hacking, but who also faces the unique challenges and uncertainties that come with it.\nWe often see the highlights, the successes, the exploits, and the wins. But beneath the surface, there\u0026rsquo;s a deeper story one filled with obstacles, setbacks, and unexpected detours. This is about those moments when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan, when life throws curveballs, and when you find yourself navigating through the unknown, clinging to perseverance and faith.\nBecause where I\u0026rsquo;ve been isn’t where I am going. This journey is more than just commands on a terminal or code on a screen; it\u0026rsquo;s about resilience, growth, and the relentless pursuit of something greater. And that’s the story worth telling.\nA Light in the Dark: The Struggles of Learning It’s easy to feel like an overthinker, the kind of person who stays indoors, reads a lot of books, and finds themselves endlessly contemplating why life is the way it is. There are days when things don’t quite click, when the pieces don’t fit, and when we find ourselves choosing the right thing in the wrong place. So many people possess gifts that simply won’t shine in the environment they are in, a truth that stretches across continents, cultures, and circumstances. There are brilliant minds, capable hands, and eager souls all around us many right here in my own country waiting for their chance to bloom.\nSome have the discipline to study for 12 hours straight, but when the electricity goes off, they’re left in the dark, quite literally, and it might be two days before the power returns and they can resume their journey toward knowledge. Others have the materials and the electricity but lack the data to connect, to explore, to learn. And even for those with access, a 3 Mbps connection makes the simplest of tasks like getting a reverse shell and running a \u0026lsquo;whoami\u0026rsquo; command feel like an eternity; each delay a reminder of the barriers still to be overcome.\nAnd yet, there’s an undying spirit in these struggles. A quiet determination that pushes one to keep going, to keep reaching, despite the constraints. It reminds me of a saying attributed to Jim Rohn: “If you are not moving forward, then change your location.” It is a call to action, a reminder that sometimes, to unlock our full potential, we must be willing to change our environment, to seek a place where our gifts can shine, where our potential can be realized.\nWhen Opportunity Knocks but the Wi-Fi Fails I once applied for a job and got a response an opportunity that seemed within reach. The next step was a network test, and just then, my usually reliable internet connection began to act up. It was as if the universe had decided to play a cruel joke. I managed to get the interview rescheduled, hopeful for a second chance since it was a remote role. But before I could even catch my breath, the reschedule was canceled, and I lost that opportunity.\nThese are some of the struggles we face. Sure, everyone has their battles, but most people only share the sunshine the successes, the moments when everything goes right leaving us to think it’s always smooth sailing. I’m not sharing this out of pity or for sympathy, but to show the reality behind the scenes… the less glamorous side of chasing dreams in this field.\nPray to God, \u0026ldquo;Sir, please, can you pull me out?\u0026rdquo; Despite these setbacks, I deeply appreciate what life has given me and the way I was raised in a place where character, discipline, and perseverance are paramount. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so much from my past employers, for which I am genuinely grateful, and I\u0026rsquo;ve soaked up all the knowledge I could, keeping that mindset of continuous self-growth close to my heart. I find strength in the bonds with my brothers Nighthawk, Blackanon, Hackyou and in the community of others who share this journey. I’m grateful to God that things are falling into place for some of us right now. And that\u0026rsquo;s what really matters: looking back at the struggles, realizing how far we\u0026rsquo;ve come, and knowing we’re no longer where we used to be.\nThere’s still so much more in store, and I believe that hard work, combined with the right connections, will eventually put every hustling soul maybe even every techie in NG, as we like to call it in the right place.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/the_unseen_struggles/","summary":"\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6cumvBZMlyO9aO4OjTDFZ2\"\r\n    width=\"100%\"\r\n    height=\"150\"\r\n    frameborder=\"0\"\r\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\r\n    allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"not-your-regular-hacking-blog\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot Your Regular Hacking Blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t your regular hacking blog.

I’ve been passionate about offensive security for six years, with five years of professional experience.\nMy journey began with platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, Facebook, Stack Overflow, YouTube, and good old Google, these were my primary sources of learning back in the day. Growing up in a military school where most devices were banned, and with limited internet access at home, I had to be resourceful. I remember stealing my mum’s hotspot because, well, where else would a 14-year-old in my country get the funds to buy a data subscription?\nBack then, I had a huge knowledge gap and honestly didn’t know what I was doing. But I studied hard, following cybersecurity experts like NetworkChuck, John Hammond, David Bombal, Stok Fredrick, NahamSec, and other top infosec influencers. Eventually, I landed an internship with an Indian company, which felt surreal, a place where I could finally grow, especially in hacking web applications.\nLater, I secured a hybrid role with a company in my region where I gained hands-on internal pentesting experience, even though I was still very much learning. From there, I took on various freelance gigs and built my skills steadily.\nMy breakthrough came with the Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) course I found on YouTube. It made me realize how much I struggled with Active Directory but also gave me a huge boost in key topics like enumeration, trust mapping, domain privilege escalation, Kerberos attacks, SQL Server trusts, and defenses and their bypasses.\nAfter clearing CRTP, I jumped straight into the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS). It was tough!, so tough that I fell seriously ill during the course. My family wanted me to quit because they had never seen me that bad, but I pushed through and passed, which gave me the confidence to finally tackle the OSCP.\nI played over 100 CTF boxes preparing for the OSCP exam and, after nearly 15 hours of intense testing, I made it out alive with 80 points which is probably a different topic entirely.\nThis is pretty much where I come from. I’ve invested time and energy, sacrificed fun, pushed harder than ever, and bled for every step forward to see myself here today. But believe me when I say; this is only the beginning of my growth.\nNow, let’s dive into why I decided to write this blog in the first place.\nYou always don\u0026rsquo;t have to push beyond what you can\u0026rsquo;t handle Fast forward to about seven months ago, I got a firsthand experience of why some people endure pain even maltreatment without complaint. Sometimes, it’s not because they want to suffer, but because they have no real options, no one they can confide in, and no one they look up to who offers advice that makes them feel safe.\nI was referred to one of the most toxic jobs I’ve ever encountered (no direct call-out here), but honestly, that organization was wild, from the management down to a few staff members.\nI loved the role because it was in consulting. It gave me invaluable experience running penetration tests for banks, fintechs, pension funds, and major players in Nigeria’s finance sector. It felt like a dream come true, and career-wise, I was truly growing and making things happen for myself.\nBut here’s the catch; my personal life was draining. I had no time for myself, no time for family, no time for my partner. The exhaustion seeped in deeply, and I began to feel the heavy weight of depression.\nEvery time I tried to voice my concerns, the response was the same: either “we’ll deduct your salary” or “you have to be at work before this time and after that.” They never really understood.\nI loved that job, but they didn’t see that I was stuck. When was the last time I did personal research, played CTF boxes with my team, or worked on a passion project? It felt like I was supposed to learn from thin air.\nIn my opinion, without self-improvement labs, research, learning. how can you expect to apply knowledge effectively at work when you’re not even growing your skills? This made me feel unsafe.\nHonestly, this was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to what I was facing. I won’t expose too much, out of respect, but I do sincerely wish them the best of luck in whatever they pursue next. Because if I ever started speaking out fully, I honestly believe that organization might not survive the fallout.\nMoving in circles I’ve come to a strong conclusion, not just an agreement that the best way to land a role is through building genuine relationships. Let people know about your struggles, your journey, and most importantly, your willingness to give your all to whatever is entrusted to you. Don’t put yourself above or below the bar; just show up consistently and let your true value shine. Demonstrate that you’re not only technically skilled but also respectful, open-minded, and genuinely interested in building meaningful connections.\nOn April 6th, 2025, I passed the OSCP and OSCP+ exams and honestly, that felt like a major milestone. What’s wild is that I barely prepared for these exams beforehand. The previous organization was draining me completely, and I’m thankful I got out as fast as I did. Imagine working somewhere that knows you have a huge certification like that coming up, self-sponsored by you, yet they don’t give you a single paid day off to prepare. Instead, they only offered me one free day the week of the exam, despite expecting me in the office four days a week. I was commuting long hours daily, and weekends were almost non-existent due to other responsibilities.\nI’m grateful I prepared ahead on my own; making cheat sheets, notes, and a quick-response plan to ensure I didn’t “run out of time before running out of options.” By God’s grace, I excelled.\nThings would move right; when you least expect My very close twin, Rami, passed his exams, and honestly, it was one of the best days of my life. We’ve never struggled so hard alongside someone else and for once, we both won together. This could very well have been our second big victory. On that day, I was overwhelmed with joy, I cried like never before, genuinely happy because everyone in our circle, not just Rami, had this achievement locked down through sheer, relentless hard work.\nI even had to download Discord on my phone just to send a voice note and really express the happiness bubbling inside me. In that moment, it truly felt like the sky was the limit.\nI’ve known Oxygen for over a year now, one of the realest and most trusted people in my network. We’ve collaborated on securing real-world startups, and he’s not just a top-tier AppSec professional, but also a true big bro who’s taught me valuable lessons beyond security lessons about life itself. Hats off to this cracked legend when it comes to web app pentesting.\nIt had been a while since we last worked on something, but Oxygen was one of the few people close enough to understand what I was going through in that toxic role. Bro is truly blood from another mother. I respect him deeply, and God bless the day our paths crossed.\nWhen I needed it the most, Oxygen referred me to one of the top fintech companies in Nigeria, and guess what? I got the offer. This time, the contract was plain, honest, and straightforward. I cried when I saw that offer because for once, it felt like the universe was finally aligning for this young boy. Even though I had a few gigs to keep me standing after losing the previous job, this opportunity hit different. I was finally stepping into a role that valued not just what I bring to the table but me as a person.\nTruly, I sit and imagine; what if God never sent \u0026ldquo;Oxygen\u0026rdquo; to me? How would I have survived that phase? I was exhausted, mentally drained, and already had therapy in mind because it was starting to feel like too much. If he hadn’t shown up when he did, things might have taken a much darker turn. It would’ve been tough, really tough to realign again, especially after all I’d lost. But God did send him. And for that, I’ll always be grateful. People like him don’t just help you with jobs; they remind you that you\u0026rsquo;re not alone in the storm.\n🌅 Outro: From Pain to Purpose If there\u0026rsquo;s one thing this journey has taught me, it’s that growth rarely comes from comfort. The setbacks, sleepless nights, losses, and emotional toll weren’t just battles, they were shaping tools. Through the chaos, I found clarity. Through the pain, I found purpose.\nTo anyone out there grinding in silence, feeling unseen, doubting themselves; your time is coming. Just keep preparing, keep pushing, and surround yourself with people who see your value, even when you don’t.\nThis blog isn’t just a story, it’s a mirror of what it means to fight through the noise and still find your voice.\nTo everyone who stood by me, my brother Rami, my Family, my big bro Oxygen, my mentors, my team, and those silently rooting for me this win is ours.\nI’m not at the top yet, but I’m no longer at the bottom.\nAnd this, right here, is just the beginning.

And honestly, I completely understand. Some platforms simply won’t bend their rules, no matter how legitimate your use case is.\nBlocker 1: DigitalOcean blocks outbound SMTP connections by default to prevent spam and abuse. This meant I couldn’t connect GoPhish to external SMTP servers at all, instantly halting the initial setup pathway.\nBlocker 2: Amazon SES allows sending only to verified email addresses and domains when your account is in the sandbox environment. To move out of this restricted state, you must submit a detailed request explaining your use case and proving it is safe, compliant, and legitimate. Even with proper justification, approvals are not guaranteed and timelines can be unpredictable.\nThe Process You can go ahead and buy a similar looking domain to the original one at https://domains.cloudflare.com/\nUpon successful purchase of the domain, navigating to DNS -\u0026gt; Records, you should have an empty dns record list like the below\nNavigate to https://www.zoho.com/mail/signup.html to create a mail account and fill in the requirements as splay\nYou should get a 7 digit OTP code to verify your account in the Email provided\nFill in the OTP to continue\nWe can skip the below page by starting the 15 days free trial (No credit card required)\nNext we can go ahead and select \u0026ldquo;Add an existing domain\u0026rdquo;\nThen add up the domain we created on cloud flare before and fill the organization name respectfully\nYou can then choose to authenticate\nOnce this is done navigate to https://directory.zoho.com/directory/[ORGANIZATION]/adminhome#/users/new\nSelect \u0026ldquo;USERS\u0026rdquo; Fill up field respectively imitating target email pattern Then click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; Below form imitates hr department at target organization\nProgress In Between Problems There are two blockers I encountered and solutions to solving them:\nOutlook/Gmail Deliverability Requirements:\nyou need to either find a way to boost the domain or work with the client’s IT team to allow list/approve your phishing domain. Without allowlisting, emails may land in Spam due to Microsoft’s filtering rules. Send test emails to confirm inbox delivery before launching the full campaign. The above mostly doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect gmail client. Using Client EML/ZIP Samples for Template Accuracy:\nIt is possible to request sample EML files from HR/IT strategically. Or even better get it via an ongoing red team engagement. Then we can Import the EML files into Zoho Mail to fine-tune your simulation, ensuring the messages align with the organization’s communication style and improve overall engagement accuracy.

How do we determine the percentage of users who clicked a link, submitted credentials, attempted to log in, or interacted with the payload in any way?\nWhile metrics are important, the more critical factor is the environment you’re testing. Every organization is different, and an effective phishing simulation requires a deep understanding of the client; how they communicate, what they’re accustomed to, and what they are most likely (or unlikely) to fall for.\nBefore execution, it’s essential to study the client thoroughly to understand these behavioral patterns. That insight ultimately determines the realism and effectiveness of the campaign.\nTo address this, I’ll walk you through a process I developed in collaboration with a highly skilled DevSecOps engineer, @Saintmalik_. Together, we designed an approach that significantly improved the success of the phishing engagement. Below is a breakdown of the metrics we used to evaluate the campaign’s performance.\nUnfortunately, this is where I’ll have to bring this blog to an end. There are still many details I’m unable to disclose for personal and confidentiality reasons. That said, I genuinely hope this write-up helps someone navigating similar challenges or planning a similar engagement.\nSometimes, sharing just enough is enough to make a difference.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/phishing_with_cloudflare_+_zoho_mail/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-hook\"\u003eThe Hook\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is only one reason why this blog is up; I tried running a phishing engagement requested by a client and \u0026ldquo;Gophish\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;SMTP\u0026rdquo; setup had me hit a few blockers than I thought, due to compliance policies and time constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after reaching out to DO and Amazon for a valid reason like, \u0026ldquo;the client is aware and this is done in a well controlled and authorized environment\u0026rdquo;; to use their SES, it still didn’t sit well with their policies.

Began crafting a dedicated workspace, shaping an environment that fuels focus and creativity. Faced the heartbreak of relationships ending Said goodbye to my second pet cat, lost to a tragic accident ;; proof that even small companions leave big spaces in our hearts. Crossed a financial milestone, earning seven figures consecutively in under three months - a testament to persistence, faith, and growth. Growth Never Stands Still My life has turned sharply toward the light ever since I chose to be intentional with myself.\nI remember beginning this year on a ₦250k job that drained every ounce of me.\nI gave it my best perfect effort, worthy lessons and yet a quiet voice kept whispering, “This isn’t the life you’re reaching for.”\nBut here’s what I’ve come to see: every path, whether lined with roses or thorns, shapes us.\nEvery detour, every hard day, is a signpost pointing us closer to the place we’re meant for, or the place our hearts have long been calling home.\nGrowth never stands still. No matter how content you feel in one place, wisdom says: always have a backup plan.\nIt’s Not the Party; It’s the People These past months have handed me some sharp realities. I’ve learned there’s no perfect workplace, only people and how people treat one another, regardless of hierarchy, can decide whether a business keeps its talent or bleeds it away.\nIt’s never about HR throwing a party to welcome you as a “respected individual.”\nWhat truly matters is the quiet, daily moments, the tone of a message, the fairness of a decision, the way leaders make room for voices at every level.\nBecause culture isn’t built on confetti (reminds me of this quote \u0026gt; “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” – Peter Drucker), it’s built on consistency, respect, and care and that’s what makes people stay.\nBuilding Wealth, Weathering Change Lately, I’ve been deeply intentional about my finances, pushing myself with the mindset that I must build lasting wealth legally, no matter how tough the journey gets. I set a clear road map toward a specific financial goal, and in less than three months, I’ve been steadily crushing those milestones.\nI can say without hesitation that tech has completely transformed my life; from bug bounty hunting to meaningful referrals. There’s so much I can’t even share publicly yet due to confidentiality, but like I said in my previous blog, this is only the beginning. And above all, I give credit to God for making all of this possible.\nAlong the way, I experienced the loss of a critical relationship. While I acknowledge my own faults because none of us are perfect, the experience served as a powerful reminder to keep my eyes on both what lies ahead and what surrounds me now. Life has a way of shifting dramatically and without warning, so it’s crucial not to get too comfortable in any season.\nA Farewell to Dante Today, I lost my beloved cat, Dante. For someone like me, who doesn’t always have people around every day; he wasn’t just a pet, he was family. From the moment this mischievous orange ball of fur came into my life, things changed. He filled my space with laughter, kept me on my toes, and reminded me that life isn’t just about work and routine.\nDante had a way of pulling me out of my own head, biting my leg when I was too focused, leaping onto me unexpectedly, or even playing a little hide and seek. As annoying as he could sometimes be, he was perfect in his own, unique way.\nRare footage of me sneaking up on him 😂:\nThis morning, in a tragic accident, I lost him. It was unintentional, but the pain of it; the guilt and the heartbreak is overwhelming. I held him on my lap for the last time, whispered my thanks for all the joy he brought me, and said goodbye.\nDante, if love could have saved you, you would’ve lived forever. Thank you for every small moment of happiness you gave me. I’ll miss you dearly, and I pray for the strength to forgive myself and to someday open my heart to another companion.\nBuilding the Life and Workspace I Once Dreamed Of One thing I remain deeply grateful for is how far my finances and stability have come. These days, there’s hardly anything I truly need that a steady two-month compensation couldn’t cover, whether it’s a powerful new laptop, a phone upgrade, a camera, or anything else I once considered out of reach. This is the life I prayed for, and I don’t take it for granted.\nI’m still building out my workspace, making sure it reflects both comfort and ambition. I recently invested in an electric desk, a supportive chair, and even a desktop to ensure nothing stands in the way of focus and creativity. Above all, I’m thankful to God for where I am today. There’s still a long road of grinding ahead, but I’m excited for the journey and I pray it stays as thrilling and rewarding as it’s been so far.\nOne thing I realized is that; No season stays the same, life can take and give in the very same breath. In just a few months, I’ve tasted wins, losses, and lessons I never saw coming. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: keep showing up for yourself. Stay humble in victory, patient in struggle, and grateful in every moment between.\nKeep investing in your growth, build genuine connections, and remember even small, consistent steps compound into incredible change. The journey isn’t about perfection, it’s about persistence. And as long as you keep moving forward, you’re already winning.

They are intended to provide users with a secure fallback in case of lost credentials, but design flaws in their implementation can convert them into direct vectors for account takeover. This research dissects a real-world vulnerability where the password reset token was incorrectly bound, enabling attackers to hijack arbitrary accounts through crafted API requests.\nPassword reset flows generally follow a standard model:\nUser requests a reset → system generates a one-time token.\nToken is delivered to the user via a trusted channel (usually email or SMS).\nUser presents the token along with a new password → server validates both and updates credentials.\nThe assumption is that the reset token uniquely maps to the account that requested it. If this binding is broken, the entire mechanism collapses.\nThe vulnerability Initiate Reset with Attacker Account : The attacker begins by attempting to log in and selecting the “Forgot Password” option. They provide their own registered email address on the application, which triggers the system to send an OTP to their inbox.\nIntercept the Reset Request : Using a proxy tool such as Burp Suite, the attacker captures the final password reset request, which contains the following structure:\nPOST /api/v2/auth/forgot-password/reset Content-Type: application/json { \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;newPassword123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;attacker@example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;256504\u0026#34; } At this stage, the server expects a valid token and the new password.\nManipulate the Email Parameter Instead of leaving the email field as their own, the attacker substitutes it with the target user’s email address: { \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;newPassword123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;victim@example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;256504\u0026#34; } Crucially, the backend fails to validate that the token was originally generated for the supplied email address.\nResult: Unauthorized Account Takeover The server responds with a success message: {\u0026#34;status\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Password change was successful\u0026#34;} In reality, the victim’s account password has now been overwritten with the attacker’s chosen password, granting the attacker full access.\nThis vulnerability arises because the reset token was only validated in isolation, without ensuring a strict binding to the original account for which it was issued. As a result, the attacker is able to weaponize their own valid reset token to reset the password of any arbitrary account.\nWhy This Was Possible: Over-trust in client input → the backend trusted the email parameter from the request body instead of binding the reset process solely to the token.\nImproper state management → the token should have been uniquely associated with the user account at issuance, but the system treated token and email as independent variables.\nConfused deputy problem → the server acted on behalf of the attacker (who held a valid token) to reset the password of a different identity, effectively misusing its own authority.\nSecurity Implications: This flaw allows full account takeover without access to the victim’s inbox. In real-world terms:\nAttacks scale easily — attackers can automate password resets against large user bases.\nPrivileged accounts (admins, agents, support) are equally vulnerable.\nSecondary attacks such as data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or fraud could follow.\nMitigation Strategies: Token-Account Binding → When a reset token is generated, store it server-side with a strict reference to the account. The client should never need to submit the email parameter during reset.\nSingle Source of Truth → The reset token alone should determine which account is updated.\nMinimal Client Input → Reduce parameters; unnecessary fields like email in sensitive flows should be removed.\nAudit \u0026amp; Test Reset Flows → Include logic flaw testing in QA, not just brute-force or expiry testing.\nConclusion: This case illustrates how subtle logic oversights in authentication workflows can escalate into systemic vulnerabilities. Security in password reset flows does not only depend on cryptographic strength (like token randomness) but also on sound state management and parameter validation. The failure to enforce a strong binding between token and identity allowed a trivial yet devastating exploit: turning a self-reset into universal account takeover.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/ato_via_forgot_password_bypass/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"overview\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverview\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassword reset mechanisms are among the most security-critical features in modern web applications.

With no mentor or anyone to guide me, I began my journey using TryHackMe.com, YouTube, and Stack Overflow to learn. Later on, I took the Security+ course from ITPro.TV, which allowed me to grasp the basics of cybersecurity, covering areas such as Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Cloud and Virtualization, Operational Security, and Incident Response.\nWith this, I was able to continue my learning journey with various other platforms like HackTheBox, PortSwigger, HackMyVM, Vulnix, etc., which gave me a higher advantage in gaining practical experience. Most notably, playing Boot2Root CTFs provided me with an opportunity to join a CTF team called \u0026ldquo;5h4d0wbr0k3r5,\u0026rdquo; giving me a more solid understanding of penetration testing.\nI then landed my first role as a web application penetration tester at a company in India. From there, I secured another job in Nigeria as a network penetration tester, where I gained substantial experience in technical skills like Active Directory and Linux administration. Additionally, I developed soft skills in managing co-workers and working effectively as part of a team.\nI was fortunate to have all my penetration testing exams sponsored, for which I am truly grateful. I have also made a lot of trustworthy and 1337 friends like hac, obx, n16ht4wk, ramsey, rami, fr3y, nerdy, ezequiel, Kunal and many others including someone who I am really looking upto, @hackingdave. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the future holds, but continuous learning is key for me. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges in a dynamic company where I can contribute to and grow with the team.\n🏅 Checklists and Certifications This is a non-exhaustive list of certifications and courses I have taken.\nCertified Red Team Professional (badge here)\nOffensive Security Certified Professional (badge here)\nCertified Penetration Testing Specialist (badge here)\nJunior Penetration Tester (PT1) (badge here)\nDante, Penetration Tester Level II lab (badge here)\nZephyr, Red Team Operator Level I lab (badge here)\nFew CVEs under my belt; CVE-2024-44871, CVE-2024-44872, CVE-2024-55341, CVE-2024-55342\nCurrently reading the book “Penetration Testing Azure for Ethical Hackers” by David Okeyode and Karl Fosaaen\n🪟 Life outside of infosec, the last 20% Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I enjoy making good food, building positive relationships, watching anime, and listening to good music. I listen to music while doing almost all of my day-to-day activities, which helps me achieve total concentration. Additionally, I am currently pursuing a degree in Criminology and Security Studies (BSc) at an Open University to expand my knowledge in addressing real-world challenges. This program enhances my understanding of criminal behavior and law enforcement, providing a broader perspective on how to protect systems and data from various threats.\n✨ Future plans I plan to pursue in the field of Cloud Security and Penetration Testing. My goal, is never to be the best but to always keep learning, improving, and making a meaningful impact in the field of Cyber security.\nThe key to accomplishing all that you ever wanted, the key to changing who you are, the key to reaching new heights, the key to limitless personal power… Is just believing in yourself; - Mr. Ping\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/whoami/","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-introduction\"\u003e❓ Introduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHii, I am a 20 yr/old security researcher/penetration tester with extensive networking, scripting, linux administration, active directory and a little cloud experience.
