[{"content":"The Hook There is only one reason why this blog is up; I tried running a phishing engagement requested by a client and \u0026ldquo;Gophish\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;SMTP\u0026rdquo; setup had me hit a few blockers than I thought, due to compliance policies and time constraints.\nEven after reaching out to DO and Amazon for a valid reason like, \u0026ldquo;the client is aware and this is done in a well controlled and authorized environment\u0026rdquo;; to use their SES, it still didn’t sit well with their policies. And honestly, I completely understand. Some platforms simply won’t bend their rules, no matter how legitimate your use case is.\nBlocker 1: DigitalOcean blocks outbound SMTP connections by default to prevent spam and abuse. This meant I couldn’t connect GoPhish to external SMTP servers at all, instantly halting the initial setup pathway.\nBlocker 2: Amazon SES allows sending only to verified email addresses and domains when your account is in the sandbox environment. To move out of this restricted state, you must submit a detailed request explaining your use case and proving it is safe, compliant, and legitimate. Even with proper justification, approvals are not guaranteed and timelines can be unpredictable.\nThe Process You can go ahead and buy a similar looking domain to the original one at https://domains.cloudflare.com/\nUpon successful purchase of the domain, navigating to DNS -\u0026gt; Records, you should have an empty dns record list like the below\nNavigate to https://www.zoho.com/mail/signup.html to create a mail account and fill in the requirements as splay\nYou should get a 7 digit OTP code to verify your account in the Email provided\nFill in the OTP to continue\nWe can skip the below page by starting the 15 days free trial (No credit card required)\nNext we can go ahead and select \u0026ldquo;Add an existing domain\u0026rdquo;\nThen add up the domain we created on cloud flare before and fill the organization name respectfully\nYou can then choose to authenticate\nOnce this is done navigate to https://directory.zoho.com/directory/[ORGANIZATION]/adminhome#/users/new\nSelect \u0026ldquo;USERS\u0026rdquo; Fill up field respectively imitating target email pattern Then click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; Below form imitates hr department at target organization\nProgress In Between Problems There are two blockers I encountered and solutions to solving them:\nOutlook/Gmail Deliverability Requirements:\nyou need to either find a way to boost the domain or work with the client’s IT team to allow list/approve your phishing domain. Without allowlisting, emails may land in Spam due to Microsoft’s filtering rules. Send test emails to confirm inbox delivery before launching the full campaign. The above mostly doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect gmail client. Using Client EML/ZIP Samples for Template Accuracy:\nIt is possible to request sample EML files from HR/IT strategically. Or even better get it via an ongoing red team engagement. Then we can Import the EML files into Zoho Mail to fine-tune your simulation, ensuring the messages align with the organization’s communication style and improve overall engagement accuracy. Login to zoho mail with the previous created account and click on the settings Icon at the top right\nYou should see a pop up window, scroll down and select \u0026ldquo;Import/Export Emails\u0026rdquo; \u0026raquo; \u0026ldquo;Browse for eml or zip file\u0026rdquo;\nOnce this is done, the email template should be imported to your inbox If an email template has an image email signature, download the image and add it manually to zoho Re-adding email signature Navigate to settings as done previously\nClick on the drop down to add the downloaded image email signature\nYou can set other preferences also to make it comfortable sending multiple emails\nPlease ignore the dummy email signature as shown above\nExporting mails from outlook/gmail to import to zoho Below are the following steps to export an email template from outlook (Ask client to do this)\nBelow are the following steps to export an email template from gmail\nThe Tough Question Since this is a phishing campaign, a common question that often comes up is: How do we accurately measure success? How do we determine the percentage of users who clicked a link, submitted credentials, attempted to log in, or interacted with the payload in any way?\nWhile metrics are important, the more critical factor is the environment you’re testing. Every organization is different, and an effective phishing simulation requires a deep understanding of the client; how they communicate, what they’re accustomed to, and what they are most likely (or unlikely) to fall for.\nBefore execution, it’s essential to study the client thoroughly to understand these behavioral patterns. That insight ultimately determines the realism and effectiveness of the campaign.\nTo address this, I’ll walk you through a process I developed in collaboration with a highly skilled DevSecOps engineer. Together, we designed an approach that significantly improved the success of the phishing engagement. Below is a breakdown of the metrics we used to evaluate the campaign’s performance.\nUnfortunately, this is where I’ll have to bring this blog to an end. There are still many details I’m unable to disclose for personal and confidentiality reasons. That said, I genuinely hope this write-up helps someone navigating similar challenges or planning a similar engagement.\nSometimes, sharing just enough is enough to make a difference.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/phishing_with_cloudflare_+_zoho_mail/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-hook\"\u003eThe Hook\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is only one reason why this blog is up; I tried running a phishing engagement requested by a client and \u0026ldquo;Gophish\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;SMTP\u0026rdquo; setup had me hit a few blockers than I thought, due to compliance policies and time constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after reaching out to DO and Amazon for a valid reason like, \u0026ldquo;the client is aware and this is done in a well controlled and authorized environment\u0026rdquo;; to use their SES, it still didn’t sit well with their policies.

Knowledgeable on defensive security concepts including SIEM and threat hunting. Actively pursuing the OSCP certification and cloud security to further validate proficiency and skill set.\n💻 Infosec, or about 80% of my life My love for Infosec started six years ago. With no mentor or anyone to guide me, I began my journey using TryHackMe.com, YouTube, and Stack Overflow to learn. Later on, I took the Security+ course from ITPro.TV, which allowed me to grasp the basics of cybersecurity, covering areas such as Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Cloud and Virtualization, Operational Security, and Incident Response.\nWith this, I was able to continue my learning journey with various other platforms like HackTheBox, PortSwigger, HackMyVM, Vulnix, etc., which gave me a higher advantage in gaining practical experience. Most notably, playing Boot2Root CTFs provided me with an opportunity to join a CTF team called \u0026ldquo;5h4d0wbr0k3r5,\u0026rdquo; giving me a more solid understanding of penetration testing.\nI then landed my first role as a web application penetration tester at a company in India. From there, I secured another job in Nigeria as a network penetration tester, where I gained substantial experience in technical skills like Active Directory and Linux administration. Additionally, I developed soft skills in managing co-workers and working effectively as part of a team.\nI was fortunate to have all my penetration testing exams sponsored, for which I am truly grateful. I have also made a lot of trustworthy and 1337 friends like hac, obx, n16ht4wk, ramsey, rami, fr3y, nerdy, ezequiel, Kunal and many others including someone who I am really looking upto, @hackingdave. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the future holds, but continuous learning is key for me. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges in a dynamic company where I can contribute to and grow with the team.\n🏅 Checklists and Certifications This is a non-exhaustive list of certifications and courses I have taken.\nCertified Red Team Professional (badge here)\nOffensive Security Certified Professional (badge here)\nCertified Penetration Testing Specialist (badge here)\nJunior Penetration Tester (PT1) (badge here)\nDante, Penetration Tester Level II lab (badge here)\nZephyr, Red Team Operator Level I lab (badge here)\nFew CVEs under my belt; CVE-2024-44871, CVE-2024-44872, CVE-2024-55341, CVE-2024-55342\nCurrently reading the book “Penetration Testing Azure for Ethical Hackers” by David Okeyode and Karl Fosaaen\n🪟 Life outside of infosec, the last 20% Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I enjoy making good food, building positive relationships, watching anime, and listening to good music. I listen to music while doing almost all of my day-to-day activities, which helps me achieve total concentration. Additionally, I am currently pursuing a degree in Criminology and Security Studies (BSc) at an Open University to expand my knowledge in addressing real-world challenges. This program enhances my understanding of criminal behavior and law enforcement, providing a broader perspective on how to protect systems and data from various threats.\n✨ Future plans I plan to pursue in the field of Cloud Security and Penetration Testing. My goal, is never to be the best but to always keep learning, improving, and making a meaningful impact in the field of Cyber security.\nThe key to accomplishing all that you ever wanted, the key to changing who you are, the key to reaching new heights, the key to limitless personal power… Is just believing in yourself; - Mr. Ping\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/whoami/","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-introduction\"\u003e❓ Introduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHii, I am a 20 yr/old security researcher/penetration tester with extensive networking, scripting, linux administration, active directory and a little cloud experience.
