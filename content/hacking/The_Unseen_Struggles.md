## **Not Your Regular Hacking Blog**

This isn’t your regular hacking blog. You won't find just the usual tutorials or technical breakdowns here. Instead, consider this a reflection, a look into the life of someone who chose the path less traveled, who found a passion in cybersecurity and hacking, but who also faces the unique challenges and uncertainties that come with it.

We often see the highlights, the successes, the exploits, and the wins. But beneath the surface, there's a deeper story one filled with obstacles, setbacks, and unexpected detours. This is about those moments when things don't go according to plan, when life throws curveballs, and when you find yourself navigating through the unknown, clinging to perseverance and faith.

Because where I've been isn’t where I am going. This journey is more than just commands on a terminal or code on a screen; it's about resilience, growth, and the relentless pursuit of something greater. And that’s the story worth telling.

## **A Light in the Dark: The Struggles of Learning**

It’s easy to feel like an overthinker, the kind of person who stays indoors, reads a lot of books, and finds themselves endlessly contemplating why life is the way it is. There are days when things don’t quite click, when the pieces don’t fit, and when we find ourselves choosing the right thing in the wrong place. So many people possess gifts that simply won’t shine in the environment they are in, a truth that stretches across continents, cultures, and circumstances. There are brilliant minds, capable hands, and eager souls all around us many right here in my own country waiting for their chance to bloom.

Some have the discipline to study for 12 hours straight, but when the electricity goes off, they’re left in the dark, quite literally, and it might be two days before the power returns and they can resume their journey toward knowledge. Others have the materials and the electricity but lack the data to connect, to explore, to learn. And even for those with access, a 3 Mbps connection makes the simplest of tasks like getting a reverse shell and running a 'whoami' command feel like an eternity; each delay a reminder of the barriers still to be overcome.

And yet, there’s an undying spirit in these struggles. A quiet determination that pushes one to keep going, to keep reaching, despite the constraints. It reminds me of a saying attributed to Jim Rohn: “*If you are not moving forward, then change your location.*” It is a call to action, a reminder that sometimes, to unlock our full potential, we must be willing to change our environment, to seek a place where our gifts can shine, where our potential can be realized.

## **When Opportunity Knocks but the Wi-Fi Fails**

I once applied for a job and got a response an opportunity that seemed within reach. The next step was a network test, and just then, my usually reliable internet connection began to act up. It was as if the universe had decided to play a cruel joke. I managed to get the interview rescheduled, hopeful for a second chance since it was a remote role. But before I could even catch my breath, the reschedule was canceled, and I lost that opportunity.

These are some of the struggles we face. Sure, everyone has their battles, but most people only share the sunshine the successes, the moments when everything goes right leaving us to think it’s always smooth sailing. I’m not sharing this out of pity or for sympathy, but to show the reality behind the scenes… the less glamorous side of chasing dreams in this field.

## **Pray to God, "Sir, please, can you pull me out?"**

Despite these setbacks, I deeply appreciate what life has given me and the way I was raised in a place where character, discipline, and perseverance are paramount. I've learned so much from my past employers, for which I am genuinely grateful, and I've soaked up all the knowledge I could, keeping that mindset of continuous self-growth close to my heart. I find strength in the bonds with my brothers Nighthawk, Blackanon, Hackyou and in the community of others who share this journey. I’m grateful to God that things are falling into place for some of us right now. And that's what really matters: looking back at the struggles, realizing how far we've come, and knowing we’re no longer where we used to be.

There’s still so much more in store, and I believe that hard work, combined with the right connections, will eventually put every hustling soul maybe even every techie in NG, as we like to call it in the right place.
