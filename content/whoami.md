### ❓ Introduction
Hii, I am a 20 yr/old security researcher/penetration tester with extensive networking, scripting, linux administration, active directory and a little cloud experience. Familiarity with security frameworks including **OWASP Top 10, Microsoft SDL, MITRE ATT&CK Framework** and **SANS Top 25**. Knowledgeable on defensive security concepts including SIEM and threat hunting. Actively pursuing the OSCP certification and cloud security to further validate proficiency and skill set.

### 💻 Infosec, or about 80% of my life
My love for **Infosec** started six years ago. With no mentor or anyone to guide me, I began my journey using TryHackMe.com, YouTube, and Stack Overflow to learn. Later on, I took the **Security+ course** from ITPro.TV, which allowed me to grasp the basics of cybersecurity, covering areas such as **Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Cloud and Virtualization, Operational Security, and Incident Response**.

With this, I was able to continue my learning journey with various other platforms like HackTheBox, PortSwigger, HackMyVM, Vulnix, etc., which gave me a higher advantage in gaining practical experience. Most notably, playing Boot2Root CTFs provided me with an opportunity to join a CTF team called "**5h4d0wbr0k3r5**," giving me a more solid understanding of penetration testing.

I then landed my first role as a **web application penetration tester** at a company in India. From there, I secured another job in Nigeria as a **network penetration tester**, where I gained substantial experience in technical skills like **Active Directory** and **Linux administration**. Additionally, I developed soft skills in managing co-workers and working effectively as part of a team.

I was fortunate to have all my **penetration testing exams sponsored**, for which I am truly grateful. I have also made a lot of trustworthy and 1337 friends like hac, obx, n16ht4wk, ramsey, rami, fr3y, nerdy, ezequiel, Kunal and many others including someone who I am really looking upto, [@hackingdave](https://x.com/HackingDave). I don't know what the future holds, but **continuous learning** is key for me. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges in a dynamic company where I can contribute to and grow with the team.

### 🪟 Life outside of infosec, the last 20%

Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I enjoy making good food, building positive relationships, watching anime, and listening to good music. I listen to music while doing almost all of my day-to-day activities, which helps me achieve total concentration. Additionally, I am currently pursuing a degree in Criminology and Security Studies (BSc) at an Open University to expand my knowledge in addressing real-world challenges. This program enhances my understanding of criminal behavior and law enforcement, providing a broader perspective on how to protect systems and data from various threats.

### ✨ Future plans

I plan to pursue in the field of Cloud Security and Penetration Testing. My goal, is never to be the best but to always keep learning, improving, and making a meaningful impact in the field of cybersecurity.
